<h2 id="intro">Briefly</h2>


<div class="post">
<p>I live in San Francisco and work for <a href="http://predictivetechnologies.com">Applied Predictive Technologies</a> (APT). I recently graduated from <a href="http://harvard.edu">Harvard</a>, earning a bachelors in physics with highest honors.

<p>I write <a href="/archive.html">here</a> on a broad range of topics. I also catalog some of the code I've written <a href="/projects.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="intro">More</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>I grew up in Hong Kong, attended high school in New Hampshire, and college in Boston. I can speak Cantonese and Mandarin fluently.</p>
<p>I like a lot of things, but especially analyzing large datasets, building software, thinking about product design and distribution, economics, and human computation.</p>
<!--
<p>Currently, I work as a consultant at APT where I help devise controlled experiments for some of the world's largest corporations. Leveraging software we built, we measure the profit impact of pricing, marketing, operations, and capital decisions, using the results to tailor initiatives that maximize returns. Our clients span many industries and include household names such as Starbucks, Walmart, McDonalds, and Google.</p>
-->
<p>Prior to APT, I crunched data for <a href="http://greatestgood.com">Freakonomics author Steve Levitt</a> and also at <a href="http://mckinsey.com">McKinsey &amp; Co</a>. In college, I worked as a research assistant at the Harvard Physics Department and a teaching fellow for Harvard&#8217;s <a href="http://cs51.seas.harvard.edu">CS51</a>.</p>
<p>I often program in my free time. I created an online campus events calendar Eventplease and am part of the Place Pulse team at the MIT Media Lab. You can view some of the code I've written <a href="/projects.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>I like food from all corners of the world. I enjoy pinot noir, puer tea, and decaffienated coffee. Friends generally classify my musical taste as &#8220;indie&#8221;, but I enjoy classical, jazz, and occasionally rap as well.</p>
<p>My politics are best described as pragmatic. Broadly speaking, I am a social liberal and a fiscal moderate. If I am unsure about a topic, I generally defer to The Economist newspaper.</p>
