<h2 id="intro">About me</h2>

<div class="post">
<p>My full name is Michael Bo-lin Wong. I live in San Francisco and work for <a href="http://predictivetechnologies.com">Applied Predictive Technologies</a> as a business consultant. I recently graduated from <a href="http://harvard.edu">Harvard University</a>, earning a bachelors in physics with highest honors. I grew up in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>I like a lot of things, but especially analyzing large datasets, programming, thinking about product design and distribution, economics, and human computation.</p>
<p>During college summers, I crunched data for <a href="http://greatestgood.com">Freakonomics author Steve Levitt</a> and also at <a href="http://mckinsey.com">McKinsey &amp; Co</a>. While school was in session, I worked as a research assistant at the Harvard Physics Department and a teaching fellow for Harvard&#8217;s <a href="http://cs51.seas.harvard.edu">CS51</a>.</p>
<p>I like food from all corners of the world. I enjoy pinot noir, puer tea, and decaffienated coffee. Friends generally classify my musical taste as &#8220;indie&#8221;, but I enjoy classical, jazz, and occasionally rap as well.</p>
<p>My politics are best described as pragmatic. Broadly speaking, I am a social liberal and a fiscal moderate. If I am unsure about a topic, I generally defer to The Economist newspaper.</p>
<p>I write <a href="/archive.html">here</a> on a broad range of topics. I also catalog some of the code I've written <a href="/projects.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The design of this site is based on <a href="http://al3x.net">Alex Payne&#8217;s website</a>. I currently host this website using github and use the <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/tree/master">Jekyll</a> static site generation system.</p>
