<h2 id="intro">Briefly</h2>


<div class="post">
<p>I live in San Francisco and work for <a href="http://predictivetechnologies.com">Applied Predictive Technologies</a>. I recently graduated from <a href="http://harvard.edu">Harvard</a>, earning a bachelors in physics with highest honors.
<p>I write <a href="/archive.html">here</a> on a broad range of topics. I also catalog some of the code I've written <a href="/projects.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="intro">Things I like</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>I like a lot of things, but especially analyzing large datasets, programming, thinking about product design and distribution, economics, and human computation.</p>
<p>Some of things I've done in the past include <a href="http://greatestgood.com">Freakonomics author Steve Levitt</a> and also at <a href="http://mckinsey.com">McKinsey &amp; Co</a>. While school was in session, I worked as a research assistant at the Harvard Physics Department and a teaching fellow for Harvard&#8217;s <a href="http://cs51.seas.harvard.edu">CS51</a>.</p>
<p>I like food from all corners of the world. I enjoy pinot noir, puer tea, and decaffienated coffee. Friends generally classify my musical taste as &#8220;indie&#8221;, but I enjoy classical, jazz, and occasionally rap as well.</p>
<p>My politics are best described as pragmatic. Broadly speaking, I am a social liberal and a fiscal moderate. If I am unsure about a topic, I generally defer to The Economist newspaper.</p>
