<h1 id="about" style="color:#660000; font-family: 'DejaVu Sans Mono', 'Courier New', monospace;">About Me</h1>

<p>I am a Research Professional at the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago. I am passionate about using data creatively to illuminate patterns in human behavior. On a typical day I write MATLAB and R code, read about economic theory and econometrics, and am quite content. 

<p>I grew up in Hong Kong. I drink tea, not coffee. I bike to work and love Honey-nut Cheerios. Once upon a time, I dabbled in management consulting, entrepreneurship, and product development. I wrote down some of my thoughts then, if you are interested. 

<p>This is what I look like, in case you were curious.
