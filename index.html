<h1 id="about" style="color:#660000; font-family: 'DejaVu Sans Mono', 'Courier New', monospace;">About Me</h1>

<p>I am a Research Professional at the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago. I am passionate about using data creatively to illuminate patterns in human behavior. On a typical day I write MATLAB and R code and think about economic theory. 

<p>I grew up in Hong Kong. I drink tea, not coffee. I bike to work and love Honey-nut Cheerios. Once upon a time, I dabbled in management consulting, entrepreneurship, and product development. Some of my writing talk about that, if you are interested. 

<p>Find me on <a href="http://github.com/mbwong">GitHub</a> or <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/michael-wong/25/547/850">LinkedIn</a>.  My email is mbwong -at- post.harvard.edu. I'd love to here any comments you have.

<p>My resume is <a href="/resume.pdf">here</a>. And this is what I look like, in case you were curious.
