    <h1>CS42 project: Introducing First party apps</h1>
     <h2>What's a first party app?</h2>
     <p>
     A "first party app" gets data directly from an online platform without going through third-party servers.
     For example, if you are a Facebook user, you are Facebook's first party. You may want the 
     ability to manipulate, understand, and use your Facebook data in ways that satisfy your needs, and 
     you deserve to do so without others snooping on you. A first party app would allow you to utilize 
     the API of the platform without data going to a third party.
     <p>
     My CS42 project evaluates the feasibility and usefulness of first party apps as a tool to help users 
     access and use their data.
     As shown below, I've written two first party Facebook apps that run entirely in the browser: 
     one helps you see how active your friends are on Facebook, 
     another helps you sift through all your photos from Facebook. 
     In these apps, data is directly downloaded into your browser from Facebook, so none of your data will 
     go through my server. 

     <h2>Thoughts and progress so far</h2>
     <p>Coding purely in Javascript is a new experience for me. There were quite a few surprises along the way. 
     Nonetheless, I was able to code up basic versions of the apps that I envisioned.

     <p>As I expected, the Facebook API has caused some trouble due to their limits on how much data can be looked up. 
     For example, an external party is allowed to read only 600 friends' Facebook walls every 10 minutes. 
     Furthermore, it appears that the Facebook API is frequently in flux, making it difficult to keep up
     with latest changes. 
    
     <p>One problem with client-side computing that arose is the browser limit on concurrent cross-domain connections, 
     which caused the data to be downloaded much slower than a native app. 
     Switching to Facebook's batch API, which handles up to 50 queries per request, helped alleviate this problem.
 
     <p>An even more troublesome barrier to having first-party applications work in the browser
     is the same origin policy. The same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from 
     one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. In particular, 
     this policy makes it impossible for me to provide a first party script that downloads files, e.g. images, from 
     another domain, unless the site gives permission for you to do so.
     This policy has caused endless headaches when trying to manipulate Facebook photos within the browser. 
     It may have been meant to offer better security, 
     but it appears to also be helping data giants keep data within their walls. 
     (I still have not yet found a satisfactory solution to this problem.) 

     <p>Despite the above bottlenecks, I believe that first party apps 
     have potential to increase data accessibility without sacrificing privacy in the future.
     The reasons are twofold. First, the infrastructure for client-side computation is improving. 
     Browsers increasingly support expressive interaction with local systems, 
     which allow for better handling of large datasets.
     Visualization libraries in Javascript are improving rapidly.
     Second, the same origin policy seems to be leakier for some datatypes. 
     While we may not easily manipulate cross-domain image data in the foreseeable future, 
     the manipuation of other types of data -- in particular text-based data -- seem to be working well. 

     <p>As demonstrated by the apps below, I was able to manipulate a meaningful chunk of Facebook data 
     even within the constraints mentioned above. I fully intend to continue working on these apps in the future. 

     <h2>Demos</h2>
     <ul>
     <li><a href="unfriendio/unfriendio.html">Unfriendio</a> 
        is a first party app that helps you find Facebook friends who are no longer active 
        by measuring how long has passed since they last updated their profile or walls.
     <li><a href="unfriendio/photo.html">PhotoFetcher</a> 
        is a first party app that fetches as many of your Facebook photos as it can, 
        and will do something more interesting when I have time to code it up. 
     </ul>
