# Things I read often

When talking to some of my friends, I have often discovered that they, like me, keep a list of things they read every now and then. I thought I would post mine here in case anyone else is interested. Some of these I have linked to in my past posts. 

__David Foster Wallace - ["This is water."][dfw]__ 

This classic speech makes the concept of enlightenment concrete in our daily lives. It is a fantastic reminder of how to live deliberately.

__Dave Eggers - ["Interview with the Harvard Advocate."][eggers]__ 

In this interview, Eggers reminds us why we shouldn't worry about what other people think and, even more importantly, why we shouldn't be dismissive of others. He shows us what it's like to embrace and to love life.

__Paul Graham - [How to do what you love.][pg]__ 

The key insight of this post is that it is really difficult to _know_ what you love. I read and reread in the past few years as I tried (and still try) to figure out what the heck to do with my life. He has a lot of astute observations about how people fail to find what they love. I recommend this for people who are still looking for their purpose in life.

__Oliver Sacks - "The Joy of Old Age. (No Kidding.)"__

Oliver Sacks is a wonderful writer, full of awe and optimism. His writings help you marvel at the wonderful world we live in. This is a lovely piece that I want to revisit as I age.

__Clay Christensen - "How Will You Measure Your Life?"__

Christensen is the kind of academic I'd like to be. An excellent thinker and teacher. He is committed to his family, his Church, and his students. He observes that a number of his classmates at HBS and his fellow Rhodes Scholars ended up in jail. He asks why. He spills his secrets for having a fulfilling, purposeful life. The key? Reflection and perspective.

__Radhika Nagpal - ["The Awesomest 7-Year Postdoc."][rn]__
Radhika gives the best advice about how to navigate high pressure environments: Stop worrying. Find friends. Have fun. Seriously. It is surprisingly simple.

__Joel Lowell - "George Saunders Has Written the Best Book Youâ€™ll Read This Year"__
George Saunders writes powerful, compelling, deep, transforming stories. He teaches you how to be kinder, how to be more vulnerable, how to find beauty all around us. But he's not always easy to read. I have found this review very useful in summarizing up some of his ideas. It's not enough, of course, and someday I might supplant this link with something Saunders himself wrote. For now I'll leave you with this New York Times review wherein you will find many quotations.

__Thich Naht Hahn - [On Love.][tnh]__ 
I learned about this little book from my one-time roommate Jamie. In my mind this book captures the secret to having a fulfilling life full of meaningful, loving relationship with people. It talks about being aware of those around us. It teaches us what it means to love someone, how to understand someone, and how, by understanding them, we can stop hurting them.
