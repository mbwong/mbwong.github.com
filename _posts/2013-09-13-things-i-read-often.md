# Things I read often

When talking to some of my friends, I have often discovered that they, like me, keep a list of things they read every now and then. I thought I would post mine here in case anyone else is interested. Some of these I have linked to in my past posts. 

__David Foster Wallace - ["This is water."][dfw]__ 
This classic speech makes the concept of enlightenment concrete in our daily lives. It is a fantastic reminder of how to live deliberately.

__Dave Eggers - ["Interview with the Harvard Advocate."][eggers]__ 
In this interview, Eggers reminds us why we shouldn't worry about what other people think and, even more importantly, why we shouldn't be dismissive of others. He shows us what it's like to embrace and to love life.

__Paul Graham - [How to do what you love.][pg]__

__Thich Naht Hahn - On Love.__ 
I learned about this little book from my one-time roommate Jamie. In my mind this book captures the secret to having a fulfilling life full of meaningful, loving relationship with people. It talks about what it means to love someone, how to understand someone and by doing so stop hurting them. 

__Oliver Sacks - "The Joy of Old Age. (No Kidding.)"__

__Clay Christensen - "How Will You Measure Your Life?"__

__Radhika Nagpal - "The Awesomest 7-Year Postdoc or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Tenure-Track Faculty Life."__
