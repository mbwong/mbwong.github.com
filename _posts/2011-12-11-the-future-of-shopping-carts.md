# The future of shopping carts

HBR has a fascinating a blog post about shopping carts! Apparently, the bigger
the cart, the more we buy.

> The head of the research lab — I'll call him Anders — opened his presentation with an interesting fact: [the bigger the cart, the more we buy](http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/41259243/ns/today-money/t/supermarkets-wage-war-your-dollars/#.Tt0j2tXrTTo). In fact, if the cart is double the size of our regular one, we buy an astounding 40 percent more than we usually do. It's not as if we need the extra items, but larger carts tap in to our primordial need to hoard food. We're still operating with our primitive brain and, ultimately, we're primed to guard against starvation. Evolutionary speaking, we're hardwired to store food in times of plenty. So, if our shopping cart looks half-empty, we'll fill it.   This research team also tracked shopping carts and analyze the shopper's behavior. Looks like if the first item a consumer picks is cheaper than expected, they will end up buying more.  
> The mini device, equipped with a GPS, plugs into the supermarket's mainframe computer, making it possible to pinpoint, within inches, exactly where the shopper is, all the while building up a personal shopping profile. In return for this behavioral data, the shopper is promised specially customized discounts, available only to them. All that's required is a quick swipe of a loyalty card on a display, positioned beside the shopping cart's handle. This is bound to change the nature of the regular supermarket shop, because for the first time ever, each customer can be tracked in real time. The consumer profile can be matched with the [consumer's actual behavior](http://blogs.hbr.org/hbsfaculty/2011/11/what-we-really-know-about-cons.html), and thus can be matched with the advertising messages most likely to attract the shopper.  

GPS systems on cart probably means it'll be harder to steal carts too. Read
