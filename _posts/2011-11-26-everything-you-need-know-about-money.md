I am loving Randall Munroe's comprehensive new infographic: [Money - A Chart
of All of It, Where It Is and What It Can Do](http://xkcd.com/980/)
[xkcd.com]. It is an huge chart, filled with all sorts of details that allow
you to visualize the different amounts of money flowing in the world. It
contains everything between single dollar amounts, like how much meals at
different restaurants cost, and huge trillion numbers of markets that comprise
our entire economy.

It's not only beautiful but also very useful as a reference. I've already
ordered a couple of these charts as Christmas gifts, one of which is for
myself.

Here are some fun facts Munroe found while researching for the infographic:
