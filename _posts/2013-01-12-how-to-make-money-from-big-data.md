#How to make money from Big Data

When I first started writing this blog, the hype around [Big Data][bd] was just [beginning][gtrends]. This time last year, McKinsey Global Institute had just published [a report on Big Data][mgi]. Now, almost every day the HBR blog has an article about Big Data. Everybody recognizes that a massive amount of data is available to us. They say, Big Data will transform and electrify the world. 

But the hype around Big Data is at least partially driven by how poorly understood it is. Its mysterious potential has only added to its intrigue. No doubt many "Big Data" start-ups will get funded to an incredible degree, even though most of them will fail. Many corporations will rush to implement a "Big Data" strategy only to find that they wasted a lot of time and money. 

Why is "Big Data" misunderstood? Because "Big Data" itself is a rather meaningless buzz word. There is not one thing as "Big Data." Unlike commodities like gold or transistors, data is highly heterogeneous. Data sets range from the highly structured like website traffic logs or transactions in a grocery store, to highly unstructured like Twitter messages or other kinds of free form texts. Data sets might be just a few megabytes or orders of magnitude larger. 

As a result of this diversity, handling these different data sets requires vastly different tools. "Data-mining" encompasses a wide rage very different methodologies: some are purely computational, some are more statistical; some techniques require formal theory, some require heavy engineering. Because there is so much data, and so many different kinds of data, and so many different approaches to handle that data, there is much potential for wasting resources on the wrong thing. 

The value of Big Data is hard to measure and extract. It requires the appropriate combination of data, talent, and technologies to handle it. How do we unlock the potential? Here are three approaches:

##Approach 1. Collect data and build it into a useful data product 

The most basic and common business model that utilizes big data goes something like this: Get your hands on a good dataset, then try to package it into a product or feature. The biggest success story in this mold is Google, which mined the Internet itself. By innovating methods to store and index the vast expanses of the Internet, Google quickly became the fastest, most reliable source for finding things on the Internet. The ad money quickly followed. 

As the Google example illustrates, the key component of this method of making money is to build a quality dataset. Google relied on its innovative algorithms to sort through the mess that was the early Internet. Yelp focused on building a community to garner restaurant reviews. Amazon relied on its scale and comprehensiveness of its marketplace to generate sales data, which it then used for recommending products to customers. 

The road to monetization for data products falls under three rough categories:

1. Sell ads: Just like Google, Facebook, Yelp, etc. 

2. Sell the data product: For example, LinkedIn sells the data to headhunters to help them find the appropriate recruits. IBM's Watson is now turning into a medical aid. Palantir sells a data platform to governments and financial institutions for deep knowledge about the world. 

3. Drive traffic to somewhere you can monetize: Companies such as Amazon or Netflix have their recommendation engines tells users about products that they might want to buy or movies they might want to watch. Android, Google News, Google Books all help drive traffic to Google Search, whether directly through links or indirectly by boosting Google's brand. 

To build a data product, you'll need a stellar product team and a good user interface. You'll also need to be good at some big data methods (machine learning, graphical methods, recommendation systems, and the like). At some point, especially if you manage to reach scale, you'll also need a group of engineers who are good enough to handle the deluge of data that you'll be processing. 

##Approach 2. Use data to drive strategy and management at an existing company

While building a data product is strictly the realm of a technology company, many more traditional companies are also sitting on top of massive amounts of data. Logistics companies have data documenting the trade of good around the word, for instance. Grocery chains know what customers buy down to the minute and location. This data can be used to drive incremental value for the firm in several ways: 

###1. Test and predict effectiveness of business programs 

The availability of much more precise data provides ripe opportunity for executives to experiment and measure causal effects rigorously, and thereby maneuver in a complicated competitive landscape with increased accuracy and confidence. For example, retailers might leverage the availability of data to [predict the sales of different clothing styles[zara] and colors ][zara] before increases, or test the effect of pricing items differently across stores.

These optimizations can help a company succeed. Leveraging data to help guide decisions reduces uncertainty about returns for large investments and allows for better operational and strategic decisions. Testing can also help lead a company to its next big idea, just as [it][subway] had led Subway to its signature and incredibly successful $5-footlong.

###2. Target customers and customize offerings

The availability of data also affords businesses the opportunity to target its marketing and products to the right customers. For example, a company can parse through sales patterns to group the appropriate customers together. Just as [Target][target] had identified the sales patterns of pregnant mothers through its loyalty program, other companies can also use their data to fine-tune and customize their offering. This opportunity is particularly strong for online subscription services. Just think of how Amazon recommends products to the users, or how LinkedIn and Facebook can recommend new friends for you on their networks. They learn the preferences of their users over time, which allows for incredibly specific targeting of offerings.

###3. Automate decision-making (i.e. speed!)

Just as hedge funds have leverage data to innovate algorithmic trading, which essentially allows computers to make investment decisions based solely on data, companies can also use data available to automate certain decisions. For example, automate inventory purchasing decisions or [pricing][hourly] based on previous sales data. This innovation will allow reduction in human processing time, increasing the speed of responses to changes in the market environment.

###4. Create better incentive alignment (i.e. transparency)

Finally, data offers the possibility of greater transparency within the company. If we see corporate management as a [principal-agent problem][pap], then increased availability of data allows us to overcome information asymmetries and lead to overall efficiencies. Data helps manage a company because it makes it easier to track key performance metrics and evaluate the moving parts of a company regularly. It will help identify problems or poorly performing segments early and allow managers to address them quickly.

Of course, there are many prerequisite steps before a company can fully utilize the data they sit on. Developing excellence in data analysis allows a company to get more accurate and powerful insights. Analysts who can dive deep and think fast will help executives understand what is actually happening on the front lines of the company. It is also critical to engender a culture for rigorous testing and targeting, in order to fully leverage the possibilities offered by Big Data.  

Finally, a nimble data infrastructure is necessary to process all the data in a quick and easy way. To empower analyst to quickly drive to analysis results, a suitable data tool set to slice and visualize the data in many ways is a worthwhile investment. These tools may not all be internally developed, so a company may look elsewhere for a readily available solution, creating yet another market need where money can be made. 

##Approach 3. Sell data management, visualization, and analytics as a enterprise service 

This brings me to the final route to capture value in the Big Data age: provide b2b data service. At the bottom of the stack we have database management and data infrastructure software such as Oracle, Teradata, and IBM. With databases quickly growing in size, innovations in this space and can lead to better and faster products and leave from for disruption. In the middle are various visualization or business intelligence packages. The market in this space is young, fractured, but highly competitive, likely due to the relative easy of enter this market. There are a plethora of solutions targeting at companies large and small. Finally, at the top of stack are software and consulting services focused on analytics of data, such as [APT][apt], optimize.ly, and Mixpanel. What distinguish this approach of making money from data is that the company itself does not own the key data. Instead, the data comes from the customer. This suggests a unique set of challenges for the business team, such as knowledge about the industry. 

Together, these three approaches will drive billions of dollars of value in the coming decades. Want to ride the wave? I wish you luck!
