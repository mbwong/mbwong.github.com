# How did Moneyball change the game?

[Tyler Cowen and Kevin Grier](http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7328539/the-
economics-moneyball)Â write about the econonmics of Moneyball, which by the
way, was both a fantastic book and a fantastic movie:

> Here's something funny about the Moneyball strategy: It is bringing us a world where payroll matters more and more. Spotting undervalued players boosts their salaries and makes money more important for the general manager; little did Billy Beane know that in the long run he would be strengthening the hand of the large home-market teams, such as the Yankees. From 1986 to 1993, payroll explained 2.2 percent of the variation in team winning percentage, and that meant spending more money yielded little return in terms of quality on the field. In the 2004 to 2006 seasons, after the Moneyball revolution was under way, payroll explained 27.1 percent of the variation in team winning percentage, which means a stronger reason to spend more.
