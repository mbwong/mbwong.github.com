# Why everyone hates on the IT department

Tom Brewster wrote [an interesting
article](http://www.pcpro.co.uk/features/371254/why-everyone-hates-the-it-
department/3) about why IT departments are held in contempt, and why this
needs to change. Here is an excerpt:

> A recent survey from NetApp showed how little IT departments feel valued by CEOs. Almost two-thirds of IT pros surveyed said they had trouble convincing their company directors about the value of a proposed project, regardless of the significant benefits it could bring.
>
> To start with, it may be wise to take IT literally out of the basement, and have staff meet with the rest of the business in a more proactive way. Even having them set up permanent residence outside of the dungeon below could lessen the sense of an unconquerable hierarchy, of which IT is at the bottom.
>
> “Certainly, it’s a danger having IT kept in the basement,” says Martin Ferguson, head of policy at Socitm, the professional association for public sector ICT management. “You’re seeing organisations that are putting IT into the basement in terms of its thinking, and not recognising that strategic importance.”
>
> To some extent, it would be sad to see the old ways gone. There’s something almost romantic about IT as the outsider. Being the underdogs, the unsung heroes, can curiously provide a job satisfaction of its own, even if the average IT worker has to live with being as unpopular as a traffic warden.
>
> But if the divide is too large, if IT doesn’t have a presence in the boardroom as well as on the floor, not only will the department suffer, but the entire business will falter.
>
> “The role of an IT department needs to change,” Ferguson says. “It needs to become more of a strategic enabler and much more involved in information management, governance of information, as well as organisational change, improvement and transformation.”
>
> IT is a core part of the business. It should be treated, and act, as such.

In a world where tech companies are disrupting all kinds of industries,
ranging from real estate to publishing, it's time for corporations to utilize
people who understand technology.
