# Mapping paths to prosperity

I've been following [Cesar Hildago's](http://www.chidalgo.com/) research on
visualizing the economy and understand from novel approaches at the MIT Media
Lab for the past year or so now. And I love it!

Hausman and Hildago recent published their la[test interactive data
visualization](http://atlas.media.mit.edu/) of paths to prosperity for
different countries. I haven't read through it in detail, yet, but it's
definitely worth commenting on.
