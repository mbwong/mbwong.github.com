# Visualizing economic complexity 

I've been following [Cesar Hildago's](http://www.chidalgo.com/) research on
visualizing how a networked economy grows at the MIT Media
Lab for the past year or so now. Hausman and Hildago recent published their [latest interactive data
visualization](http://atlas.media.mit.edu/) of how different sectors in the economy grow in
different countries. It promises to advance the field of developmental 
economics by providing a much more nuanced and detailed view of economic activity.
