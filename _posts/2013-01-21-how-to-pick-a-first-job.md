# How to pick a first job

You've made it mostly through college. You've done some soul-searching and you've settled on a career direction. Perhaps like me, when you graduate you want to do something related to Big Data and software. Now where you should get your first job or internship?

My recommendation is that you position yourself to be in a place where you can learn the most about the things you're interested in. 

Why? Because acquiring skills opens up new opportunities for you in the labor market, and gaining knowledge of the big picture allows you to better position yourself competitively in the future. Learning means building up your own human capital. It will determine your future productivity. When you evaluate your first job, the learning opportunity is the most important parameter to consider.

(Before I continue, though, let me clearly state that this recommendation assumes that you have some idea of what you want to do with your life. If you aren't sure what career path you're interested in, read my essay on [how to find a calling][ss] as well.)

Here are some components that contribute to a good learning experience:

1. *Breadth of exposure*: You can learn a lot simply by working in an environment that allows you to see a lot of moving parts. For example, you might choose to work at a consulting firm where you can meet people from different parts of the corporate ladder in different industries. You might choose to work at a big software company where you can look at different kinds of code, understand the engineering processes, and see how different tools are used. You might become an assistant to a senator and learn about the legislative process. These places give you the big picture. These high exposure jobs will teach you to know whom to talk to regarding different issues and provide you with a mental model of how things are actually run. 

2. *Intensity and variety of tasks*: You can speed up your learning process by doing a lot of things really fast. Ask people at the company for a task breakdown by percentage. The things that you'll do will also be the things that you learn. If you'll be on the phone mostly talking to clients, you'll learn how to do that effectively. If you're writing reports or PowerPoints most of the time, you will hone those skills. Don't just focus on the business model of the company; understand what your job actually is. 

3. *Talent and experience of your co-workers*: What you learn also depends on the caliber of people you surround yourself with. Work very closely someone who knows a lot and has a lot of high-powered work and you will learn to see the world as they do, as well as the habits that help them succeed. I think of the meteoric career advancement of Sheryl Sandberg, who worked for Larry Summers during her undergraduate career and then at the World Bank and the Treasury. Equally, you could go to a company that attracts top talent throughout the ranks. Think McKinsey or D.E.Shaw, a leading hedge fund. You will learn from everybody around you. 

4. *Boss / work culture*: The work culture and your boss can make or break your happiness. Your boss can make you miserable or turbo-charge your career. When you evaluate a job, ask around to understand whether your boss will support and defend your work. Does she care about your personal growth and act as a mentor? Similarly, the culture of a company can enable you to learn or block you from being productive. If your work place has toxic politics that prevent you from learning from others, you will end up wasting a lot of time dealing with the politics instead. 

5. *Support infrastructure*: It's worth it to inquire about the resources that the company will devote to helping you succeed in the job as well. The question is: Will you be able to focus on the thing you actually care about? For example, does the company provide you with sufficient compensation so that you don't have to worry too much about paying bills? Are there the internal staff, policies, support teams, or tools that you need in order to be productive? Will the additional perks (e.g. free food and gyms) help you focus on your job? How will these things affect your ability to learn?

During my senior year, I had a choice between three job offers: I could be a consultant at [APT][apt] (a big data software company), a consultant at [The Greatest Good][tgg] (a data consultancy started by Freakonomics author Steve Levitt), or a solutions architect at [Mixpanel][mxp] (a web analytics startup). While all three of my jobs belonged under the Big Data umbrella, the job descriptions, business models, and cultures of the companies were quite different. 

The main reason I chose APT was that I believed that I could learn the most there about Big Data technologies and analytical methods, as well as the Big Data ecosystem at large. These were the things that I was most interested in. APT had the scale and a transparent culture that I would get to see what management consultants see, i.e. different industries, as well as a bit of what product managers see, i.e. the product cycle.

Inevitably there will be a non-career dimension to an employment decisions as well. Family, friends, and location should factor your decision, for your first job is far less important than the people around you. My advice here is only useful if you know what you want to learn and your options are inline with your personal values other than career advancement.
