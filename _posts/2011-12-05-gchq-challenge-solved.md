# GCHQ Challenge Solved!

No, not by me. But by [Dr Gareth Owen](http://www.gre.ac.uk/schools/engineerin
g/contact/staff_directory/Profiles/OwenGareth) of Greenwich.

For those of you who don't know, an enigmatic code challenge appeared on the
web a couple days ago and has attracted a lot of attention. The challenge
website [canyoucrackit.co.uk](http://www.canyoucrackit.co.uk/), which contains
simply a stream of text, explains nothing about the context or purpose of the
challenge.

The website was made by GCHQ, a UK intelligence agency, as a recruiting
device. According to [Slashdot](http://yro.slashdot.org/story/11/12/02/0257206
/uk-recruiting-codebreakers-via-social-networks), "a spokesman said the
campaign aimed to raise the profile of GCHQ to an audience that would
otherwise be difficult to reach." You can read more on [BBC's
website](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-15968878).

Within days, an academic at the University of Greenwich in England has posted
a solution to the challenge. And it turns out the solution is quite
complicated and is likely to challenge even computer science graduates.

So if you don't feel up for the challenge, you can take a look at the
solutions [here](http://gchqchallenge.blogspot.com/). They involve
disassembling binary, encryption algorithms, building a virtual computer, and
are quite interesting!
