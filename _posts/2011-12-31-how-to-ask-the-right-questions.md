# How to ask the right questions

In the workplace, one of the most useful skills to possess is the ability to
ask the right questions. In my view, questions serve various purposes:

1. It helps you collect information - You want a clear picture of how something works and presumably someone knows the answer. Your goal is to squeeze it from them. For example, you're looking for a job and you want to know what the hiring process is like. Or you're assessing a job offer and you want to know what the company culture is like. Getting good answers can save you time, help you perform better, make you more money. 
2. It can improve personal relationships - Questions demonstrate that you care and you're invested in the other person. 
3. It helps you frame discussion - The goal here is influence. By asking questions, you help others thinking through problems. You allow them to understand what you care about. 
4. It can inspire creativity - By questioning assumptions, by forcing others to think harder, you place the burden of thinking on them. Asking the right questions can improve their contribution to your team's productivity. For example, you may ask "How can things be done differently?" or "What happens if our supplier fails?"
5. It forces your group to align your thinking - This is extremely important in a team setting. Only when you ask the hard question and confront your differences, do difference in goals and thinking appear. And they always do. 

So how do you ask the right questions?

Think about the type of question that you are asking. Open questions ("how?"
or "why?") generate a discussion. Closed questions ("What?", "Where?", or
"When?") elicits a quick answer. A healthy discussion requires both types of
questions. Asking too many closed questions will feel like interrogation.
Asking too few and your discussion quickly may easily become simply
speculative.

Avoid negativity or leading questions like "Why aren't you performing?" or
"Don't you think John is underperforming?".

I recall listening to Max Levchin talk about firing people at Startup School
2011. He said that employees are much less angry when they are asked to leave
rather than told to leave. If firing by asking works, imagine leading by
asking.

Finally, I believe it pays to ask about something until you understand it
deeply. Be nice, but don't settle for a half-assed answer. Perhaps you were
asking the wrong person, not the wrong question. If you have read Michael
Lewis's "The Big Short" or "Boomerang" you would know that the best investors
ask tough questions and really understand what's actually good on.

So actionable items?

* Go to meetings with a list of questions to ask. Not talking points.
* In casual settings, ask questions to understand who these people are, what do they know, what do they care about out, what insights do they have. 
* Listen to their answers and think about what their answers tell you. 
* Keep asking questions. Don't settle for a bad answer.
