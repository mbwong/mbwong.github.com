# The things that parents do

There is a moving piece in the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/28/booming/when-theyre-grown-the-real-pain-begins.html?ref=booming) about the heartbreaks of a parent seeing their grow beyond their capacity to help: 

>When my children were growing up, I groped my way through stormy nights, chaotic dinner hours, endless mess, nail-biting basketball games, tortured term papers, bad dates and the agony of college admissions. During all those wild ups and downs in the back of my head was the calming thought: once my children get into college, my work will be done. In retrospect, having little kids was a breeze. As long as you hugged them a lot and made good food, things seemed to be, for the most part, O.K. You could fix many problems, and distract them from others. Your home could be a haven from all that might be painful and difficult in the world beyond.
>
>All of that changes when they are grown. They fall in love, break their hearts, apply for jobs, leave or lose the jobs, choose new homes, can’t pay the rent for those new homes and question their choice of profession. They forge their way, all just outside of your helping reach. Then, when bad things happen, they need you like crazy, but you discover that the kind of help you’ve spent 25 years learning how to give is no longer helpful.

The author goes on to describe her own emotional struggles as she witnesses her sons' trials and tribulations as a young adult. And, despite its brevity, her article gripped me and led me to tear up. I thought of the summers I spent back home since coming to the United States to study. I recalled how my parents could not stand my laziness or the mistakes I make. They desperately tried to make up for the advice they had neglected to give when I was still around. They try to devise life plans for me according to the world they see. They loved me extra but felt extra helpless. 

Even as I kept rebelling against my parents and making mistakes, I also came to realize how deeply they have influenced my life. I know not whether my parents realize how often I think of their examples and their admonitions. As cliche as it may sound, I owe my life to them in more than a literal sense. If someday I manage to live my life fully and nobly, I will owe it to my parents. I want to write down the things that they taught for me, so that I may teach these to my children and other who might care to listen.

Both my parents dedicated their lives to ideals. 

My parents also insisted that we must love. This is the .

## Freedom to Explore

Freedom is a double-edged sword. 

## Cultural capital

I belong to two traditions. Though I am a US citizen and have US-educated parents, I grew up in a traditional Chinese household in Hong Kong. Unlike many of my peers’ parents who focused on their children’s acquisition of technical or scientific knowledge, mine made sure that I mastered not only the languages but also the literature of my two cultures. My parents hired tutors after class to educate me on the history of the East and the West. I attended two kindergartens—a Chinese one in the morning and an English one in the afternoon. Through middle school, I enrolled in a local school where elderly Chinese teachers taught me calligraphy and Chinese classics; when I was 14, my parents sent me to a boarding school in New England to learn core Western values and ideas. 

As a result of this upbringing, my perspective on both cultures is different from both that of my peers from Hong Kong and that of the Asian Americans I’ve met in the US. I have observed and participated in political movements in both America and Hong Kong. I have personal experiences with different systems of laws and cultural norms. I have deep friendships with people of vastly different cultural perspectives. When thinking about social theories, I have not one but two reference points.
