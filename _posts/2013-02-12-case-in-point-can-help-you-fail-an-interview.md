# Case In Point Can Make You Fail an Interview

Mark Cosentino's Case In Point is a staple for anybody who's interested in a consulting job. And yes, I read it too in my senior year of college. But not everybody who uses it aces interviews. Why? Here are three mistakes that I had made and that now, as a case interviewer, I see people who read Case In Point make:

1. __Market-sizing by cohort__ - Case In Point has a seemingly brilliant solution to the panic that ensues when your interviewer asks you to estimate the number of potential customers: Do it by population cohort. Divide up the US population by age groups and calculate market size for each. And you might think "Oh, great. When I don't have anything to say, I can use this to fill up my time!" Big mistake! Most of the time, it makes little sense to market-size by cohort. If a product is targeted to a specific age group, then just calculate for that age group. If it isn't, just assume an average. Your goal is to get the estimated answer in the quickest, simplest way (without sacrificing too much accuracy). Cohorting will waste you a couple of important minutes and make the interviewer pretty bored! This is a sure way to get dragged into the arithmetic weeds and trip yourself up. A better way to avoid panicking is simply to practice estimation questions over and over, and time yourself. Try to get to an answer consistently under a minute, and you'll be ready for prime time. 

2. __Using a framework you don't really understand__ - In most life situations, it is better to talk about things you understand well, than to talk about things you really don't. So before you mention Porter's Five Force or the BCG matrix, please, please make sure you actually understand its purpose! Most of the time, it is not really relevant for your case. If you use these complicated frameworks correctly, you earn a couple of Brownie points; but if you do not, it is very embarrassing! Until you are a case interview pro, it's best to shy from using the more complicated frameworks. The potential upside just isn't very high. You really don't need to know these frameworks for a case interview, so I'd advise against even reading that part of the book until you've done 10-20 practice cases. 

3. __Using the wrong framework__ - I also have often seen people jump into an answer with the wrong framework. To Cosentino's credit, he repeatedly warns against just jumping straight into an answer. And yet so many others and I still fell into the trap of too quickly choosing the wrong framework. If you're still on your first 10 interviews, take at least a couple minutes to analyze the question on your head before saying anything. There's just no hurry. Mull over the question. Focus on using common sense to address the question itself, rather than to find and then recite a framework. Try a divide-and-conquer strategy, think: What are the components of the question? What kind of data do I need to give a good answer? The danger of becoming acquainted (but not yet thoroughly familiar) with frameworks is that you will use them as a crutch when you're panicking. You just launch into sizing the market or reciting a framework. This is the wrong thing to do. 

## So what good is a framework? 

Rather than using a framework as an answer key, frameworks are best used as a conceptual tool. What the interviewer wants is to observe you thinking in real time and frameworks can give you ideas about how to organize your thinking. For example, if the interviewer doesn't specify the price of a product she wants to sell, the pricing frameworks can help you quickly identify potential answers. If you are familiar with Case In Point frameworks, you will know that you can price based on cost, customer willingness to pay, or competitor prices. Having such frameworks in the back of your head will help you quickly think of the components you need to consider when facing a case question. 

Frameworks also give you an idea of what the structure of case discussion should like. They are examples of good answers, and they should be thought of as such and not more. Becoming familiar with them will help you think of good answers. But don't stick to them rigidly. Rote memorization won't get you very far. Please take the time to understand the frameworks! I see too many bright kids fall into this trap. 

## Conclusion

So should you still buy Case In Point? Probably, yes. It is still full of great advice about how to approach a case question and how to organize your thoughts. If you've never done a case before, Case In Point will do you much more good than harm. It will give you a much better idea of what you're getting into. But a lazy and uncritical reader may slightly be misguided. You are now warned.

And, oh yes, let us not forget the best tip from Cosentino... Practice! In my experience, it is the single best predictor of interview success. Start early. Find someone intelligent and intense to practice with, every day. Estimate everything in your daily life. If you're running low on case questions, just read WSJ and think of each article as a case question. 

Good luck.
