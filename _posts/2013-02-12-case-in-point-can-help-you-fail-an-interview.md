# Case In Point Can Make You Fail an Interview

Mark Cosentino's [Case In Point][cip] is a staple for anybody who's interested in a consulting job. And yes, I read it too in my senior year of college. But not everybody who uses it aces interviews. Why? Here are three mistakes Case In Point helped me make. And now that Iâ€™m an interviewer, I keep seeing others make them too!

1. __Using a framework you don't really understand__ - Cosentino provides advanced concepts like the "7 S'es" or Porter's Five Forces. But, as in most life situations, it is better to talk about things you understand well than to talk about things you really don't. Before you mention the BCG matrix, please, please make sure you actually understand what it is all about and how to use it! Most of the time, the more advanced concepts are not really relevant for your case. The potential upside of using them isn't very high either. If you use these complicated ideas correctly, you might earn a couple of Brownie points; but if you do not, it is very embarrassing! Until you are a case interview veteran, it's best to shy from using the more complicated frameworks. You really don't need to know the advanced frameworks for a case interview, so I'd advise against even reading that part of the book until you've done 10-20 practice cases. 

2. __Market-sizing by cohort__ - Case In Point has a seemingly brilliant solution to the panic that ensues when your interviewer asks you to estimate the number of potential customers: Do it by population cohort. Divide up the US population by age groups and calculate market size for each. And you might even think "Oh, great. When I don't have anything to say, I can use this to fill up my time!" Big mistake! Most of the time, it makes little sense to market-size by cohort. If a product is targeted to a specific age group, then just calculate for that age group. If it isn't, just assume an average. Your goal is to get the estimated answer in the *quickest, simplest way* (without sacrificing too much accuracy). Cohorting will waste you a couple of important minutes and make the interviewer pretty bored! This is a sure way to get dragged into the arithmetic weeds and trip yourself up. In fact, I think market sizing is probably one of the weaker sections of the book, and it's probably because there's no simple magic tricks to it. The best way to get better is time yourself and practice getting to a quick estimate within a minute or two. By shortening the time you take, you do less math and give yourself less opportunity to mess up. 

3. __Missing the question__ - As an interviewer I've seen people jump into rambling answers that completely misses the question posed again and again. Even though Cosentino repeatedly warns against this in Case In Point, many of us who've read the book still fall into the trap of blabbering on about a framework rather than focusing on the question. We just launch into sizing the market or estimating the price without thinking sufficiently about what the case was actually about. We misuse frameworks as a crutch when we're panicking, and we just begin to recite the things we read about. This is absolutely the wrong thing to do. Instead, make sure to take several minutes to analyze the question in your head and jot down notes before launching into an answer. Mull over the question. Focus on using common sense to address the question itself. Try a divide-and-conquer strategy, think: What are the components of the question? What kind of data do I need to give a good answer? There is no hurry. 

## So what good is a framework? 

Rather than using a framework as an answer key as you prep for interviews, think of frameworks as conceptual tools. What the interviewer wants is to observe you thinking in real time and frameworks can give you ideas about how to organize your thinking. For example, if the interviewer doesn't specify the price of a product she wants to sell, the pricing frameworks can help you quickly identify potential answers. If you are familiar with Case In Point frameworks, you will know that you can price based on cost, customer willingness to pay, or competitor prices. Having such frameworks in the back of your head will help you quickly think of the components you need to consider when facing a case question. 

Frameworks also give you an idea of what the structure of case discussion should like. They are examples of good answers, and they should be thought of as such and not much more. Becoming familiar with them will help you think of good answers. But don't stick to them rigidly. Rote memorization won't get you very far. Please take the time to understand the frameworks! I see too many bright kids fall into this trap. 

## Conclusion

So should you still buy Case In Point? Probably, yes. It is still full of great advice about how to approach a case question and how to organize your thoughts. If you've never done a case before, Case In Point give you a much better idea of what to expect, and its basic approach is largely sound. But an uncritical reader may be misguided and fall into one of the above traps. You are now warned. 

And, oh yes, don't forget the most important tip from Cosentino... Practice! In my experience, it is the single best predictor of interview success. Start early. Find someone intelligent and intense to practice with, every day. Estimate everything in your daily life. If you're running low on case questions, just read WSJ and think of each article as a case question. 

Good luck.
