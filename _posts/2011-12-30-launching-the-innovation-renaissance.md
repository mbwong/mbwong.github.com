# Launching the Innovation Renaissance

[Launching the Innovation Renaissance](http://www.amazon.com/Launching-
Innovation-Renaissance-Market-ebook/dp/B006C1HX24/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-
text&ie=UTF8&qid=1324586109&sr=1-1/) is the name of a new book by Alex
Tabarrok of [the Marginal Revolution blog](http://marginalrevolution.com/).
It's a quick and fun read that gives a clear picture of what needs to be done.

Here's my summary of the key concepts - all of which I agree with:

1. Patents are only effective in spurring innovation when the cost of innovation is far higher than the imitation cost (read: pharma). In industries such software, patents are actually slowing innovation because innovation is iterative and patents limits access to previous innovation. 
2. Prizes are more effective tools to spur innovation, e.g. Netflix prize, DARPA prizes. 
3. We need better education - Teachers need to be better paid. 
4. The liberal arts college degree is oversold. Many humanities graduates are failing to find jobs. Trade schools will result in better allocation of human capital.
5. Government needs to shift focus from redistribution to innovation. Reduce zero-sum nature of political games. 
6. Government needs to make immigration for high-skilled labor much easier. 

It is really worth reading and only costs $2.99. You can buy it
