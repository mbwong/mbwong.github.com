## An open letter to Benny Tai

Dear Prof Tai, 

I am a student from Hong Kong living in the United States. My heart goes out to all those who fight for democracy in Hong Kong today. I wish I could be in Hong Kong today. 

Like you I deeply believe in the democratic principle. I believe that democracy is the necessary safeguard for our freedoms, without which we cannot prosper as individuals. Today our freedom of speech and rule of law are under attack and democracy is necessary to guard against these incursions. 

Like you I believe that democracy is the only just political system. Only through majority rule can any government legitimately claim sovereignty or representation of people. It is only under democracy the varied interests and concerns of citizens are properly addressed through deliberation, negotiation, and voting. Today the government is all to happy to ignore the needs of citizenry. Democracy can help fix this. 

And like you I am angry. I am frustrated. I am impatient. Our cause is just and sincere. And I stand with you in your ardent plea for democracy. I believe that democracy is necessary and right. And I want to strive so that the people of Hong Kong can live to see democracy realized. 

When fighting for civic liberties in the United States, Martin Luther King Jr wrote that we must have a tough mind and a tender heart. It is for this reason that that I write to you with the fierce urgency of now. In this critical juncture for Hong Kong it is to important have a clear-eyed assessment of the tribulations that we confront. I write you because of my faith that you are a reasonable man with a tough mind and a tender heart. 

I am deeply troubled by the turn of events in Hong Kong. As I observed the hundreds of thousand demonstrators who oppose Occupy Central, I worry that the democratic movement in Hong Kong is moving in the wrong direction. As I watched as academics and community leaders began to sign petitions against Occupy Central, as polls show that the Hong Kong citizenry is deeply divided, I became even more worried. Today we have businessmen going to Beijing to voice concern over growing disobedience in Hong Kong. How is it that so many people have turned against the cause? 

I am very worried that the current strategy adopted by the Occupy movement have not succeeded in persuading the public. Rather it has only divided the population. It is brought out the reactionary voices. It has alienated the moderates. 

To advance democracy in Hong Kong we need a broader coalition. If the turn-out at the anti-Occupy rally has taught us anything, it is that we still need to convince the people of Hong Kong, even those who skeptical of our cause, that democracy is just and necessary for future prosperity of our city. We must build a united front. It is not enough to voice our own beliefs and to voice them loudly; it is necessary to persuade. 

Democracy is a living process through which conflicts are resolved and the common interest is advanced. Democracy as political system requires broad participation and support. We must work to provide conditions for the successful implementation of democracy. Democracy cannot survive nor take root in a society is that divided and mistrustful. When democracy is realized in a radicalized society, such the Weimar republic, the outcome has been disastrous. Our movement to advanced democracy must also be democratic. It must reflect the desires of a broad coalition of Hong Kong citizenry, and not merely a radicalized few. We should not sow discord. We should not create distrust. 

We also cannot forget the lessons of Tiananmen. We are confronted with a inhumane regime of mobsters with supreme power. A few ten thousand protesters will not be enough to turn Hong Kong towards democracy. We need to persuade, especially those in powerful positions, that democracy is right and necessary and reasonable. We need letters from many political and community leaders in Hong Kong to Beijing requesting greater democracy, more representation. We need pressure from people in all walks of life in Hong Kong to promote our cause. To do so we need a broader coalition. We cannot remain divided. 

Martin Luther King said that the arc of justice is long but it bends towards justice. Our march to democracy has been long. But it is not too late to change tactics. It is never too late to do what is right. It is better to acknowledge that we have failed rather than to continue down the road to perdition. I urge you today to begin the work of building a broader coalition and to rebuild trust in our community. To succeed in our democratic cause, we need popular support for our cause, and we must not paint ourselves into a corner. 

I have faith that your belief in democracy will not preclude your considering of my voice and reasoning. 

My very best wishes to you, 

Michael Wong
