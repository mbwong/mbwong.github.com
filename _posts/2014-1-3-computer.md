#Computer Eats World 

The robotic age is upon us. Wearable computing is on the verge of a major breakthrough. Google is rapidly acquiring robotics start-ups. Amazon is investing heavily in drones. In [Marc Andreessen's parlance][eats], computers is rapidly eating the world. The societal consequences of such technological progress, however, are still not well understood.

Internet scholar [Jaron Lanier][lainer] has argued that technology progress is not ideologically neutral and that new technology reshapes our psyche and society in myriad ways. [Kevin Kelley][kelley] famously asked: "What does technology want?" Much ink has been spilt on the consequences of designing open vs. closed platforms on innovation and public discourse.

Can we subject the hypothesized effects of technological progress on societal structure and welfare to rigorous analysis? Economists have long emphasized the importance of technological progress as an engine of growth. But many models treat technology as a black box. Larry Summers suggested in [a recent speech to the NBER][summers] that computers might be changing our economy in a way that is different from past technologies. If so, it seems important to open this black box and understand it works, for there may be many nuanced aspects to technological progress that matter.

First, consider how computers are fundamentally changing the way information travels through our society. The Internet is rapidly replacing printed media. Increasing shares of human activity are digitally recorded. Most consumers now partake in a single globalized information exchange economy, where our personal data is tracked, sold, and analyzed. The goods we trade, such as reputation and attention, are more informational and behave differently than the physical goods we use to trade. 

I suspect this transformation has had enormous consequences for the economic organization in many industries. Does the emergence of a single globalized informational economy mean much greater returns to scale for companies or greater monopoly power? Are companies better able to price discriminate? Are two sided markets increasingly prevalent and how does this impact the distribution of welfare between consumers and producers? 

Second, consider how production factor markets has been changed by automation via computers. Because of automation, capital inputs are increasingly substitutes rather than complements to labor inputs in production. As Summers explains, this could lead wage rates to fall and creates a greater divergence in incomes. Which is exactly what is happening. Inequality has been growing for the past 30 years already. In particular, the share of income by the top 1% has grown rapidly while much of the middle class is sinking. Is this bifurcation of class linked with the replacement of low skilled labor by computers? 

Third, consider the large swathes of society have not yet been altered by computing technology. In fact, the worlds that computers are _not_ eating are perhaps even more consequential than those they are. 

Notable is the lack of automation in human capital production so far. The relative cost of education has sky-rocketed even as many other goods have declined. Part of the reason may be that classrooms have not evolved much in the past 50 years and the provision of education remains largely the same. Despite the hype around online education, online college courses are still mostly consumed by college graduates. Education reform remains slow. It is no wonder that [Peter Thiel][thielgraph] has been raving about the potential for change in the education market: Today the technology has not reached a tipping point yet, though perhaps we are getting closer now.

The provision of healthcare also seems to have seen relatively little automation. While medical technology has improved, the medical care is still highly labor intensive. Health costs have also sky-rocketed: Is this also because productivity of healthcare workers have not significantly changed? Or is this driven by mis-incentives in the healthcare market? 

Finally, consider how many properties of local networks that impact social and human capital have not yet been fundamentally altered by computing technology. Studies have shown that the people you are likely to communicate with online are not so different from those you would communicate with offline. The importance of location in real estate prices, education outcomes, crime rates, social capital have hardly diminished despite the interconnectivity of the Internet age. Neighborhood and peer effects remain strong, whether for elites or for the urban poor. The persistence of these local networks has myriad implications for social mobility, especially in an age where the income distribution is divergent. 

Put together the above observations and you might suspect, as I do, that "technological progress" writ large does not simply matter for economic growth. Rather, particular idiosyncrasies of the computing technological changes are shaping the peculiarities of societal changes we witness today. The big question is not simply "will the pie grow?" but "how will it grow?". Much is changing and much is at stake. I look forward to pondering the issues that Summers has pointed out.
