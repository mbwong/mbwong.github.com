#Travel checklist

After two nearly disastrous trips to the airport, I decided to outsource my pre-travel mental checklist from my brain to my blog so that I don't forget things again. (Where better to leave an easily accessible memo than the Internet?) Here is my list of the most important things to remember when traveling: 

* drivers license, passport (visa if needed)
* computer, charger (adapter if needed)
* phone, charger (foreign SIM if needed)
* money, debit/credit cards, octopus cards
* appropriate clothing (coat, belt, ties, dress shoes, swim trunks as needed)
* appropriate gifts
* toiletries (razor, retainer)
* medication (allergy, painkiller)
* details of transportation and lodging arranged 

Did I leave anything? (Hope not.)
