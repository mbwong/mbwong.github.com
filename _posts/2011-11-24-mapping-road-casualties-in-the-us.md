# Mapping road casualties in the US

Despite Harvard students' tendencies to jaywalk, the area around Harvard
Square has been fairly devoid of traffic deaths in the past 10 year, according
to [this powerful map](http://map.itoworld.com/road-casualties-usa) that
transport data mapping experts [ITO World](http://itoworld.com/) produced
using [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) and [official data from
the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration](http://www-
fars.nhtsa.dot.gov/Main/index.aspx).

Browsing the map, it appears that traffic accidents tend to concentrate on
certain roads and highways.

cool interactive map yourself.
