# Google+

According to [this fascinating article on ReadWriteWeb](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/google_was_never_a_facebook_competitor.php), the purpose of Google+ is not to replace Facebook. Instead it is to gather social data to more effectively understand users and better mine their advertising value. The end results? The "most targeted advertising platform in history":

> Contrary to popular belief, Google+ was never created to directly compete for people's time on the internet. A simple, ad free system, Google+ was launched to compete for users' personal data. Becoming the primary platform for social networking would simply be a bonus.
>
> Speaking at the Monaco Media Forum recently, Nikesh Arora, Google's chief business officer said that Google+ is a platform that allows the bringing together of all the services and products that they currently offer. It was never "just about getting people together on one site and calling it a social network".
>
> The real power behind what Google has created comes down to the integration of Google's products, meaning that as people are using the search engine, they are also logged into Google+. The combination of that user data and knowing when people are actively searching for something opens up the possibility of the most targeted advertising platform in history, and Google are very aware of the fact.
