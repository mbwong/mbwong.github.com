# In Facebook we trust?

A couple weeks ago, I wrote a [blog post](http://mbwong.com/2011/11/30/why-
zucks-law-is-not-the-new-moores-law.html) about how Facebook's "frictionless
sharing" threatens its user experience. I suggested that Facebook might be
saved with smarter algorithms that better discern between "priority"
information and "junk".

On the contrary, [Andrés Monroy-
Hernández](http://socialmediacollective.org/2011/11/28/in-defense-of-
friction/) believes that automation of trust itself is problematic, and
removing friction leads to the loss of trust, and hence value.

I agree that human generated signals are important, but I wonder: Are
"frictionless" signals really useless? I think it's still too early to say. We
have systems that rely on friction (by which I mean, labor-intensive human
input) to generate useful content, such as Reddit's reputation system. But the
quality of Google's PageRank and Netflix's recommendation engine suggests that
there is potential for mining existing data that weren't collected with much
friction.

It's a wild exaggeration to claim that frictionless sharing will bring about
the end of the social web. I tend to think that the social web still has a
long way to go. There's good reason to believe that algorithms leveraging
natural language processing and image recognition techniques will become
increasingly good at understanding unstructured data. This means that we can
better estimate the importance of a shared item. Technologies like
[diffbot](http://www.diffbot.com/) come to mind.

Trust via human computation still works better for now, but as long as
frictionless sharing doesn't crowd out real human sharing, the addition of
frictionless sharing could still make Facebook a better place.
