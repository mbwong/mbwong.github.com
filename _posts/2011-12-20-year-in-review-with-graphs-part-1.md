# Year in review (with graphs)

Finals are done and I'm finally back home in Hong Kong. It's time for some
"year in review". Here are a couple graphs that document the big political
events of the year. I'll do another post about cultural trends and tech trends
in next posts.

**1. The Eurozone crisis** - The creation of the single currency in 1999 lead to convergence in government bond interest rates. Now they have since diverged since the PIGS have faced budget crises and Eurozone leaders have continually met to negotiate bailouts. Without a doubt, 2011 will be seen as a watershed year for the Eurozone, which may well break up if a proper political compromise is not reached between the leaders of Europe.

**2. Occupy Wall Street ** - Here is a chart that shows the growing income inequality in the US. This has been the object of protest across the nation.

**3. Arab Spring** - Here is a map with the colors indicate the number of reports from BBC this year. As we can see, Egypt, Libya and Tunisia received lots of coverage for successful revolutions, while Syria and Yemen received much attention for continued violence towards revolutionaries.

**4. Debt crises around the world - **This map shows how much debt in total we have around the world. This year saw the US budget crisis and the Eurozone crisis, both of which were results of over-leverage and over-consumption in the West.

**5. Republican Primary** - Republicans just can't decide on a presidential nominee. Or, they just hate Mitt Romney. Rick Perry, Herman Cain, and now Newt Gingrinch experience surges in popularity.
