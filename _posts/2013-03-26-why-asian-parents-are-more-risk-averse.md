# Why Asian parents are more risk averse

I make two observations:

1. Parents in general are more risk-averse than their children when facing a career decision for the offspring. Anecdotal evidence suggests that parents prefer children to take more risk-averse jobs (e.g medicine) than risky ones (e.g art), even though the children may prefer the riskier vocation. 

2. Chinese or Korean parents are observed be more risk-averse than American parents. Anecdotal evidence might suggest that more parents exert pressure their offspring into risk-averse jobs in Asian countries. 

The reasons for (2) are often laid out to be some form of cultural difference, perhaps a difference in taste. However, often economic forces can shape culture and taste. Is there a theory that might be able to explain both (1) and (2)? I suspect that the differences in the risk-profile of parents and their children with regard to the children's career can be explained by differences in incentive. 

Suppose kids choose a career based on maximization of their own utility. Part of utility comes in the form of money, but part of it is also happiness. They might also experience pressure from parents. 

Possible reasons that parents might exert pressure include: (A) Absent government welfare, children are expected to support their parents in retirement. This means that a less risky income for the kids is an important. (B) The costs to a poor familial reputation provides a stronger incentive that the offspring follow a more well-trodden path. (C) Compared to money, happiness is more difficult to transfer from person to person. Since money is more directly observed, parents prefer to maximize finances. (D) Children generally out live their parents. A riskier career may mean long-term payoff. However, parents prefer more immediate returns, since they will not be able to absorb the longer term rewards of a child's career. 

This framework suggests four ways that the utility function of a parent is different from a child, explaining (1). It also explains (2): Asian countries have less developed government welfare and there is a stronger expectation that children provide for their parents. Furthermore, the costs to a poor familial reputation is higher in Asian societies, leading to a strong incentive for the parents to pressure kids into less risky jobs. 

This model needs much more refinement, of course. Interestingly, however, the above analysis suggests that a weakening of the family may lead to more optimal career choices by the offspring. 

There may be informational effects as well. For example, children have less complete knowledge of the world and therefore may be less capable of utility maximization. On the other hand, the world is changing rapidly, so parents are also liable to having an outdated understanding of the world also.
