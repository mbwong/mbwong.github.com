[Tyler Cowen](http://marginalrevolution.com/) gave a speech at TED (transcript
[here](http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/8w1/transcript_tyler_cowen_on_stor
ies/)) warning us from thinking too much in stories. He warns against
believing the simple narratives, and especially the inspiring ones that TED
embraces.

> So what are the problems of relying too heavily on stories? You view your
life like "this" instead of the mess that it is or it ought to be.

Indeed, stories can be powerful and we are all too prone to believing them.

> We all like to think advertising only works on the other guy, but that's not
how it is. Advertising works on all of us, so if you're too attached to
stories, what will happen is people selling products come along, and they will
bundle their product with a story.

 His advice?

> Be a little more messy. You're here for some messy reason or reasons, and
maybe you don't know what it is, and maybe I don't know what it is, but anyway
I'm happy to be invited.

We have the same problem with social media status updates, with powerpoints,
even with newspaper articles. We try to convey information in sound bites, in
simple narratives, but inevitably it falls short. Life is messy. The data we
get is messy. So, keep questioning these simplifying stories!
