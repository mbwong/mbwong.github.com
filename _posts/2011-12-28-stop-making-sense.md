# Don't believe the stories

[Tyler Cowen](http://marginalrevolution.com/) gave a speech at TED (transcript
[here](http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/8w1/transcript_tyler_cowen_on_stor
ies/)) warning us againist thinking too much in stories. He asks us not to 
believe the simple narratives, and especially the inspiring ones that the TED
series embraces.

Indeed we are all too prone to believing such powerful stories. As Cowen puts it, 
"We all like to think advertising only works on the other guy, but that's not
how it is. Advertising works on all of us, so if you're too attached to
stories, what will happen is people selling products come along, and they will
bundle their product with a story."

When we are bombarded with social media status updates, with powerpoints,
even with newspaper articles, when we try to convey information in sound bites and in
simple narratives, the information inevitably falls short as a description of 
the world we live in. The truth is complicated. Life is messy. The data we
get is noisy. 

His advice?

> Be a little more messy.Â You're here for some messy reason or reasons, and
> maybe you don't know what it is, and maybe I don't know what it is.

So keep questioning these simplifying stories! Don't believe the stories!
