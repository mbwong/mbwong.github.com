Check out Google's [Think Insights](http://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/insights/)
project! It is a neat repository of reports about consumer trends and industry
research that builds on top of Google's data warehouse.

Think Insights will help advertisers understand their customers, similar to
how [McKinsey's Global Institute](http://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/) helps
companies keep up with the latest business trends. It primarily focuses on
marketing, with topics ranging from social media to industry verticals to
demographic targeting.

Follow them on [Google+](http://,%20similar%20to%20McKinseys%20Global%20Instit
ute,%20but%20focuses%20on%20marketing). I will be blogging more as I read up.
