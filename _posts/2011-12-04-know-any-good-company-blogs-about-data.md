# Know any good company blogs about data?

Last week, my friend Dave and I chatted about emergence of web 2.0 companies
like Google and Facebook that sit on so much data containing potential
insights about human behavior and society.

It's always fun for me to read about some of the things that their data has
taught them. I can think of a couple fantastic company blogs that let us
glimpse at their data. [OKtrends](http://blog.okcupid.com/),
[bitly](http://blog.bitly.com/), and the [Facebook Data
Team](https://www.facebook.com/data) come to mind. I also blogged about
[Google's Think Insights](http://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/insights/) last week.
I imagine there must be many more.

Do you know any good company blogs about data? Please share if you do!

**Addendum:** Found a couple!
