Jonathan Zittrain, a prof whom I'm taking a class with, is offering a talk
"Minds for Sale" about online crowdsourcing and labor market at Harvard today
at 3pm. Since I wasn't able to attend, I decided to watch the youtube video of
a previous version of the talk last night:

I'm a huge fan of Zittrain and it's a fantastic talk. Here are some of the
interesting legal and ethical problems that arise:

Perhaps most interesting though are the many examples of online labor and
collaborative filtering:

* Netflix prize, X-Prize, and Innocentive - Prizes for scientistic breakthrough
* SamaSource - microtasks for Kenyan refugees
* LiveOps - Fungible, online phone operators
* Amazon Mechanical Turk, Askville, and Turker Nation
* ESP Game and ReCapture - Luis von Ahn
* Google - PageRank a kind of crowdsourcing
* Internet Eyes - Crowdsourcing private surveillance
* Crowdsourcing US Border Control 
* Smartdrive - Crowdsourcing driving quality control
* Open Mind Common Sense
* Sense Networks

Other emerging trends come to mind too:

* Kickstarter - collaborative funding
* [Kaggle](http://www.kaggle.com/) - prize platform
* [Codeacademy](http://www.neowin.net/news/codecademy-crowdsources-programming?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+neowin-main+%28Neowin+Main+News%29) - collaborative teaching

The implications of these markets and platforms are well worth thinking about.
