# A Revolution in Online Education

Online education is all the rage today. Coursera, Udacity, EdX, Khan
Academy are quickly becoming household names. They promise to change
the face of education. But will these massive open online courses (MOOCs)
actually change the landscape? In my mind, there are two ways that these new technologies 
will change the world: (1) A revolution in access and (2) a revolution in measurement.

## A Revolution in Access

This first educational revolution under way is an expansion of educational access. 
Online platforms allow people to access knowledge more cheaply. 

In the off-line world, a teacher 
can teach 30 kids at a time, maybe 100 in a day; with online teaching, a teacher
can reach thousands of students at once. If our old education model
can be parodied as chalk talks on blackboards, online education
promises to scale up this model, giving the world a bigger, more
accessible lecture hall. Anyone across the world with a good Internet
connection can more cheaply access this auditorium, put on headphones
and tune in to hear an ever louder chorus of lecturers.

This cheaper way to deliver knowledge brings many benefits to our society. 
It means the cost of education may be 
brought down for many. It means that students may get more 
choices. It may drive competition amongst teachers, thereby improving quality. 
It may even lift people out of poverty and reduce income inequality 
by helping people invest in their human capital more cheaply, 
and allow the labor force to respond to shifting market environment quicker \[1\]. 

With universities around the 
world now joining the rush to open up their courses to 
anyone who has an internet connection, an optimist has much to be 
excited about. 

Skeptics will question whether this concept of online education is a
sufficient answer to our education needs, however. Admittedly, MOOCs are 
a fast food version of a university class. A growth in scale
necessarily discounts some of the difficult-to-measure benefits of
learning in person, such as social learning or participation in
discourse and argument. It diminishes the role of teacher in 
individually aiding a student's progress. 

It is also incredibly difficult 
to grade thousand students at one with credibility, much less provide 
individualized feedback. An enterprising student might learn much 
from these online platforms, but employers are rightfully doubtful 
the legitimacy of online education. The college degree still means much,
much more. 

To truly bring about a revolution in education, MOOCs must do much more than what 
Wikipedia or TED can already offer. With the over-abundance of information on the Internet, 
increased accessibility to information is hardly a new and exciting thing. 
It would be a critical breakthrough if MOOCs began to provide believable 
accreditation to students. To do this, quality issues need to be mitigated 
so that course completion credibly signifies real learning. 

The recent entry of competing Ivy League schools into the foray promises 
an opportunity to improve the quality of course materials, and increased 
competition may drive up the quality these courses. This revolution in 
educational access is just getting started, but may accelerate dramatically 
in the coming years. 

## A Revolution in Measurement

Accelerating the revolution in education access is a concurrent 
revolution in measurement of student behavior. 
As a by-product of the increasing uses of educational 
technologies inside and outside the classroom, 
student performance is now more easily measured and tracked. 
Much information can be gained from increased interactivity between 
the learner and software, and they can in turn improve 
the quality of our educational system. 

Parents and teachers can actually have much greater visibility into 
the child's learning progress with the increased technology-enabled 
data collection. Furthermore, increased data collection creates 
a closed loop environment in which the education providers can understand 
and respond to the needs of students. For this reason, big data and 
analytics are an essential part of online education's potential for value creation. 
An enhanced feedback loop can create a much more intimate and customized learning 
experience for kids.

I am especially excited about the steps that Khan Academy (KA) is taking in 
this direction \[2\].  KA's Salman Khan emphasizes, for example, the value of student's 
being able to stop or replay instruction videos at their own pace. Today, 
the interactive problem sets that KA provides are customized based on student's 
performance and idiosyncrasies. 

In stark opposition to the aforementioned lecture 
model, online learning in the form that KA is pushing forward customizes and 
individualizes the student learning experience. These feedback loops 
encoded within the software will help enrich and optimize a student's learning. 

KA has also begun partnering with both schools and parents. For example, 
parents are able to use online tools to guide their kids through their exercises.
KA is also bringing technology into the classroom, letting students work online, 
allowing teachers to track student performance online, and freeing class time 
to work on topics that performance data suggest student need help with. 

This model of combining online education with offline education create 
great synergies, allowing software and in-person teaching to be highly complementary. 
These steps will lead to a higher quality education for all. 

Coursera is also making efforts in these aspects as well. 
Their pedagogy statement emphasizes better measurement of student mastery and
instant feedback. With these general orientation, these start-ups will no doubt also 
come up with other methods to improve pedagogy. The details of possible 
improvements to pedagogy are listed in detail on [their webpage][coursera], 
and it is well worth a read.

Together, revolutions in education access and performance measurement promise to change 
how we learn. 20 years from today, our education system will be completely 
transformed by these advances. I foresee a bright future.
