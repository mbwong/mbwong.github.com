# Jotform seized for user-generated phishing content

Two days ago, an online form-building start-up Jotform posted a [blog
post](http://www.jotform.net/blog/45-JotForm-com-Suspended) announcing that:

> As a part of an ongoing investigation about a content posted in our site, a
> US government agency has temporarily suspended
> our[jotform.com](http://jotform.com/) domain. We are fully cooperating with
> them, but it is not possible to say when the domain would be unblocked.

It seems that many users are angry at Jotform for having content that led to
the seizure, even though the supposedly infringing content is suggested to be
a phishing form posted by users.

Here are some more [juicy details from
theNextWeb](http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/02/16/online-form-building-
startup-jotform-has-its-domain-suspended-by-the-us-secret-service/). Here is
[Jotform founder's message on Hacker
News](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3597821). It appears that [the
original site](http://www.jotform.com/) has now been restored.
[Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2012/02/17/did-godaddy-help-
the-secret-service-shut-this-website-down-without-a-warrant/) wonders if the
seizure has been done without a warrant.

This raises uncomfortable concerns for entrepreneurs. The safe-harbor
protection for copyright seems not to extend for other forms of user-generated
content. While this is unlikely to harm large companies such as Google or
Facebook, it seems that those who require protection, such as budding
businesses like Jotform, can suffer fairly large losses. It therefore looks
likely that this incident will soon be a larger issue for the Internet
community.
