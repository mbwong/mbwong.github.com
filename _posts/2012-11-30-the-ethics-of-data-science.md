#The Ethics of a Data Scientist

##Schrödinger's Cat and the Unintended Consequences of Measurements

When we do social science, the goal is to find measurable and significant explanations to human behavioral patterns. Yet, this measurement has the potential to alter the social environment that we study as well. 

The closest analogy may be in modern physics. In quantum physics, there is a famous example of Schrödinger's Cat, concocted to illustrate how measurement itself results in a change in the thing being measured. 

> A cat, a flask of poison and a radioactive source are placed in a sealed box. If an internal monitor detects radioactivity, the flask is shattered, releasing the poison that kills the cat. The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics implies that after a while, the cat is simultaneously alive and dead. Yet, when we look in the box, we see the cat either alive or dead, not both alive and dead. - Wikipedia

In more technical speak, the state of an object is described by the wave function, which gives the probability of an object in various states. Upon measurement, the wave function of the object collapses into a delta function, thus its overlying physical state is actually fundamentally changed. The state of the cat is different before and after the measurement.  

#The Importance and Danger of Measurement

Much of social progress is fueled by improvements in measurement. 

However, social scientists must be aware of the
