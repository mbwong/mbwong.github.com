# McKinsey Global Institute tackles Big Data

Today I watched Michael Chui’s presentation at Strata 2011 and read the
McKinsey Global Institute report ["Big data: The next frontier for innovation,
competition, and productivity ."](http://www.mckinsey.com/Insights/MGI/Researc
h/Technology_and_Innovation/Big_data_The_next_frontier_for_innovation) I
figured someone might find it useful to see my notes here. It's a comprehesive
overview of what C-level executives should know about big data.

Here are my notes:

Big data will be the basis of competition and driver of growth for many
business. Why?

* It creates transparency
* It enables experimentation
* It exposes variation (and thereby improves performance)
* It allows for segmentation and customization
* It allows for automatic decision-making (e.g. algorithmic approaches to pricing)
* It allows for innovation (which can then be monetized)

Which sectors have the biggest growth in data? - Healthcare, energy, retail,
utilities, security.

What are the many challenges?

* Data policies – privacy, security, IP
* Access to data – allows for combining datasets, e.g. healthcare
* Technologies
* Organizational change and talent

There will be a huge shortfall of talent!

What companies benefit the most from big data? - depends on:

* Amount of data
* Variability in performance
* Customer and supplier intensity
* Transaction intensity
* Turbulance

What should organization leaders do?

* Inventory datasets - proprietary, public, purchased
* Identify value creation opportunities and threats
* Building internal capability (talent and culture)
* Strategy for developing IT capabilities
* Address data policy issues
