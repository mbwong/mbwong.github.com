# How to find a Calling

LinkedIn's founder Reid Hoffman recently published a book titled "The Start-up of YOU." It wisely suggests that we should all think of our careers as start-ups. Succeeding in today volatile economic environment requires adaptability, a strong personal network, and entrepreneurial thinking. 

You have somewhere between 40 and 50 productive years to come. To be productive, you must focus and pick one thing to pursue. But like me, you might start out with interests in many things and hence have a number of career choices. How do you choose what my start-up will be about? What will you do with your life? What's your calling? It's a huge and looming question.

## Follow your passion?

In America, many have bought into the notion that we should follow our hearts. When we think about our careers, we often ask: "What are you passionate about?" It's the consumerist idea that we should get what we want that has been beaten into us by Hollywood and its romantic comedies. We think of Oprah and Donald Trump, who openly advise that we only ought to do what we want to. 

Despite my Chinese (hence more conformist) roots, I drank the Kool-aid too. As I grew up I came to believe that I should follow my passion. I assumed that whatever I did I must love deeply. My destiny was to blaze a path doing something I loved. 

But, after four years of exploring different interests during college, I realized that passions can be a fickle and temporary thing. Unlike the studious pre-med student who always wanted to be a doctor, my passions were all over the map. One month I am excited about web technologies. Then I'm excited about some new politician or a new book. I had relied heavily on infatuations to guide my life, but it only made me uncommitted and unfocused. Now that I realize that passion alone is not a good guide for life planning. 

As Cal Newport wrote in [this New York Times op-ed](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/30/jobs/follow-a-career-passion-let-it-follow-you.html), 

>[The Cult of Passion] puts a lot of pressure on the rest of us — and demands long deliberation. If we’re not careful, it tells us, we may end up missing our true calling. And even after we make a choice, we’re still not free from its effects. Every time our work becomes hard, we are pushed toward an existential crisis, centered on what for many is an obnoxiously unanswerable question: “Is this what I’m really meant to be doing?” This constant doubt generates anxiety and chronic job-hopping.

>As I considered my options during my senior year of college, I knew all about this Cult of Passion and its demands. But I chose to ignore it. The alternative career philosophy that drove me is based on this simple premise: The traits that lead people to love their work are general and have little to do with a job’s specifics. These traits include a sense of autonomy and the feeling that you’re good at what you do and are having an impact on the world. Decades of research on workplace motivation back this up. 

How I wish I had this perspective and didn't agonized about my choices! The Cult of Passion is indeed a heavy burden. 

Yet, while Newport is absolutely correct in his diagnosis of the problems with the Cult of Passion, his alternative seems too arbitrary. In the op-ed, Newport writes that he ended up choosing to pursue graduate studies after college, simply because of a preference for the East Coast. "I would have been equally content heading out to Microsoft’s headquarters near Seattle," he wrote. "Or, with the advance from my first book, I could have hunkered down in a quiet town to write." 

Does it really not matter at all? Just do whatever? Does it not seem cavalier, even dangerous, to decide your career on a factor that may be a bit irrelevant? Doesn't Newport's logic seem lacking? 

Unlike many of us, Newport had fantastic options to choose from -- and he had a foothold in each of the career paths he could take. What if you didn't? What if you had to work hard to get those options? Perhaps Newport is sufficiently talented in both computer science and writing that either option would have worked out, but how could you know? Which options should you strive for? 

## Experimentation and Reflection

What Newport correctly argues is that it is more often how you proceed in one's career that ultimately matters. What does one prioritize? What does one bring to the job? What skills does one work on? One has got to make the most out of the career one has chosen. This means continually make conscious choice to improve one's career. Career choices don't boil down to a choice at the beginning of college. 

At the same time, a suitable amount of introspection and deliberation is still necessary for optimal career choices. There are important choices to make. The answer to how to pick a career is more nuanced than simply brushing it off or saying that it doesn't matter. 

There are some career choices that are plainly wrong for some people. People go down paths that they should not have. It might be a career that is too limiting. They might become stuck due to personality flaws, external pressures, or simply because they never had any interest in building the skills necessary to succeed in the field. They may be too frightened to buck their parent's advice and do what's right for them. They might end up in faraway places away from people they love. 

These scenarios often result from either a lack of experimentation or a lack of introspection. Experimentation requires risk taking and introspection requires honesty. Neither are necessarily easy things to do. But with some work, better career choices can be made as one knows oneself better. It is a continual process of trial and error. It requires trying a wide range of things and continually thinking about how to respond to experience. 

During sustained introspection, I've asked myself: 

* What makes me excited? 

* What kind of person do I admire and want to emulate? 

* What makes me feel accomplished at the end of the day? 

* What makes me feel accomplished at the end of my life? 

* How do I respond to different tasks and assignments?

* What are my talents and what career uses my talents the best? 

* Whom do I love and care about and how can I be close to them? 

* What values do I care about and how I can lead a life in line with those values?

Having learned a few things about me and my world, I have found it easier to match my life and personality to a career that makes sense. For me, the best decision lay in the intersection of my answers to the above questions. If my choice fulfills not only a deep-seated interest, but also many other things I want and care about, then I am safeguarded against some faulty assumptions I might have made, or a fickle passion that may have dissipated. 

So finding a calling requires experimentation: Try new things, fall in love, fall out of love, fail, succeed -- and along the way -- introspect, strategize, and plan for the future. Carry with you a list of things you care about, and try to optimize accordingly. Let your passion follow you and help you define what your career will become. Like Marcus Aurelius writes in his Meditations: "It's up to you!"
