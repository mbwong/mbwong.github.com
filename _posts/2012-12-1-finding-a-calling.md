# Finding work you love

LinkedIn's founder Reid Hoffman recently published a book titled "The Start-up of YOU." It wisely suggests that we should all think of our careers as start-ups. Succeeding in today volatile economic environment requires adaptability, a strong personal network, and entrepreneurial thinking. But how do I choose what my start-up will be about? I have somewhere between 40 and 50 productive years. To be productive, I must focus and pick one thing to pursue. But I have a multitude of interests and hence have a number of career choices. What is my calling? It's a huge and looming question.

## Should I follow my passion?

In America, there is the notion that we should follow our hearts. When we think about our careers, we often ask: "What are you passionate about?" It's a consumerist idea that we should get what we want that has been beaten into us by Hollywood and its romantic comedies. We think of Oprah and Donald Trump, who openly advise that we only ought to do what we want to. 

Despite my Chinese (hence more conformist) roots, I drank the Kool-aid too. As I grew up I came to believe that I should follow my passion. I assumed that whatever I did I must love deeply. But, four years of trying different things during college made me realize that passion can be a fickle and temporary thing. Unlike the studious pre-med student who always wanted to be a doctor, my passions were all over the map. One month I am excited about web technologies. Then I'm excited about some new politician or a new book. I had relied heavily on infatuations to guide my life, but it only made me uncommitted and unfocused. Passion alone is not a good guide for life planning. 

Cal Newport puts it very well in [this New York Times op-ed][newport]:

>The Cult of Passion puts a lot of pressure on the rest of us — and demands long deliberation. If we’re not careful, it tells us, we may end up missing our true calling. And even after we make a choice, we’re still not free from its effects. Every time our work becomes hard, we are pushed toward an existential crisis, centered on what for many is an obnoxiously unanswerable question: “Is this what I’m really meant to be doing?” This constant doubt generates anxiety and chronic job-hopping.

>As I considered my options during my senior year of college, I knew all about this Cult of Passion and its demands. But I chose to ignore it. The alternative career philosophy that drove me is based on this simple premise: The traits that lead people to love their work are general and have little to do with a job’s specifics. These traits include a sense of autonomy and the feeling that you’re good at what you do and are having an impact on the world. Decades of research on workplace motivation back this up. 

## A more rational approach

Rather than following your passions or ideals blindly, a better attitude is to optimize your career so that you get to do more and more things that make you happy. This way your life is not a wild romantic pursuit, but rather a march towards fulfillment. It may not be as thrilling, but I have found this approach to be less stressful. 

Optimizing to find work you love, I think, requires a mixture of exploration and reflection. Exploration is necessary to find out exactly what makes you happy. Without different experiences under your belt, there is simply no way for you to figure who you are and what you prefer doing. This means that you take the risks and put yourself out there. It means overcoming some of your fears of the unknown and failure. It is not always easy, but often worth it. 

Reflection is also necessary to find out exactly what makes you happy. What could you learn from trying new things if you don't take the time to process your experiences? During introspection, you might ask yourself: What made me happy today? Am I doing work that I admire? What am I doing well and what I can do better? Reflection requires discipline. To introspect properly, you need to be honest with yourself. What good do you do for anybody, if you lie to yourself about how you don't mind doing a job that you secretly hate?

When I graduated from college, I had a vague idea of what field I wanted to be in, but I knew little about what kind of job I really wanted. Finding happiness was, and still is, an iterative process: Try new things, fall in love, fall out of love, fail, fail, fail, -- and along the way -- introspect, strategize, and find a way to improve. Over time, I've been able to do more and more things that I love. It is hard work. There are no easy or quick answers. But, at least for me, this more deliberate and rational approach has worked better than simply "following my passion."

A great essay I've read on this topic is [this lengthy discussion by Paul Graham][pg]. It has many more important points about the things that might derail you from finding work you love, such as money and prestige. As DFW says, I wish you more than luck.
