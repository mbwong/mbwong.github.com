# Privacy policies and network neutrality


I've been busy with my last semester in college, but here's some stuff that
I've been reading: 

[A fun paper by two CMU researchers](http://www.mendeley.com/research/the-
cost-of-reading-privacy-policies/) about the unreasonable expectation for
users to read privacy policies. From the abstract:

> The national opportunity cost for just the time to read policies is on the
> order of $781 billion. Additional time for comparing policies between multiple
> sites in order to make informed decisions about privacy brings the social cost
> well above the market for online advertising. Given that web users also have
> some value for their privacy on top of the time it takes to read policies,
> this suggests that under the current self-regulation framework, targeted
> online advertising may have negative social utility.

Also, a pretty technical economics theory paper on [the economics of network
neutrality](http://www.stern.nyu.edu/networks/Economides-
Hermalin_Economics_of_Network_Neutrality.pdf), which neatly builds on the
price discrimination discussion we had two weeks ago. Tyler Cowen summarizes:

> A strict welfare calculation is indeterminate in the theory of price
> discrimination, yet the standard presumption is that price discrimination is
> welfare-improving.  That is all the more likely to be the case when investment
> in new capacity, and usage, is endogenous.

To me, the author's conclusion sounded more like (in their own words):

> The focus of much of the network neutrality debate has been on schema that
> are forms of second-degree price discrimination. Because content providers
> must be induced to play their part in any such price discrimination scheme,
> the set of feasible schema is restricted. Hence, even if network neutrality—no
> exclusion and no discrimination—is not welfare maximizing generally, it could
> be welfare-maximizing within this restricted set. In particular, if the
> elasticity of content demand with respect to transmission time does not
> increase with households’ time sensitivity for the content, then network
> neutrality is welfare maximizing within the set of feasible schema. If that
> elasticity is invariant with households’ time sensitivity for the content,
> then network neutrality is welfare superior to all other schema (feasible or
> not).

I'll need to look more closely before I have something intelligent to say
about it.
