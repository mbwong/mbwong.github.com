# Favorite Things of 2013

I know, I know. I'm way behind on my blog posts. It's already 2014. But anyway here are my favorite books and movies this past year, most of which are not actually from 2013. 

* __[The Act of Killing.][act]__ An absolutely stunning documentary where the filmmaker follows a perpetrator of genocide in Indonesia reenact the act of killing. This is a film about the psychology of violence and a portrait of modern day Indonesia. It will make you wince, laugh, tear up. It might even change the way you think about humans.

* __[Is The Man Who Is Tall Happy?][tall]__ A film animated by Michel Gondry containing an interview with Noam Chomsky. Both enlightening and beautiful.

* __[Jiro Dreams of Sushi.][jiro]__ I'm a bit late to the party; even though it came out a few years ago, I only watched it this year. It is officially one of my favorite movies ever. I'm very much inspire by what Jiro, Michelin Star winning sushi chef, says about dedicating one's life to craftsmanship. Jiro says "Once you decide on your occupation, you must immerse yourself in your work. You have to fall in love with your work. Never complain about your job. You must dedicate your life to mastering your skill. That's the secret of success, and is the key to being regarded honorably."

* __[Danny Kahneman - Thinking: Fast and Slow.][dk]__ This book will no doubt go down in history as one of the definitive studies of behavioral psychology and economics. This book penetrates into deep truths beyond any pop science book I've read. It's changed my thinking and my life. I use the concepts I learned in this book on a daily basis, not only in my research but also in my personal life. I simply don't know what my life would be without it. Yes, given its hype, it might be on your reading list already. But you might also be procrastinating on actually reading it, since it is thick and you might expect a work that encapsulates a lifetime's work of a Nobel laureate to be dry and technical. But it is not: it's highly readable, with short chapters and a easy-going style. Highly recommended.

* __[Mark Edmundson - Teacher.][teacher]__ This memoir is a loving account of how a fresh graduate from Harvard went to working class Medford, Mass. to teach philosophy and opened the mind of the author. It is a thought-provoking exploration of what it means to teach and how to do it in a way that deeply affects the student. The teaching exemplified in this book sets the standard for the kind of teacher I aspire to become. (Hat tip to [Hugh Koeze][hk].)

* __[Gary Becker & Kevin Murphy - Social Economics.][social]__ Ever wonder why there are lines outside restaurants? Why don't restaurant owners raise prices to satisfy unmet demand? Ever wonder about the economics of segregation or fads and fashions? This book examines these social phenomena using the tools of economics. A very enlightening read!

* __[Herman Hesse - Narcissus and Goldmund.][hesse]__ A lovely novel that explores the tension between a creative life and a cerebral one. It touches on some of the deepest truths about living. (Hat tip to [Evan Czaplicki][cz].)

* __[Paul Sally Jr. - Tools of the Trade.][tools]__ (Warning: nerd alert!) Sally used to teach the introductory proof class at UChicago and this book was the text. How I wish I came across this book earlier in my life rather than to try to slog through Rudin's real analysis textbook, which isdry dry dry! This book makes abstract math enjoyable through wit and concise explanations. I highly recommend reading through this book as a great introduction to proof concepts and fundamentals of modern mathematics, if you need it.

* __[Leonard Bernstein - Norton Lectures.][bernstein]__ This lecture series by Leonard Bernstein is incredible. Watch one of the greatest showman in history presents history of classical music with allusions to physics, linguistics, literature, and poetry. I thought I need something about music history: These lectures broadened and deepened my understand tremendously. It is a masterpiece.
