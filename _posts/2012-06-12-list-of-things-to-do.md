# The Harvard Bucket List

After four years in Cambridge, I thought I'd make a list of things that I think a Harvard undergraduate should experienced. Some of these things I've personally enjoyed. Others I've heard are amazing. Anyway, this isn't the official bucket list, which consists merely of sex in Widener, Primal Scream, and pissing on the John Harvard statue. This list is longer, and hopefully will help you find more adventures during your time at Harvard. Good luck!

## First, the Harvard things

* Hook up at First Chance Dance _and_ Last Chance Dance

* Skip lecture

* Streak during Primal Scream!

* See the Adam House's underground murals

* Copy someone else's problem set or go to office hours and beg for answers

* Visit the Sackler on an open house

* Procrastinate in the D-Hall

* Socialize / pull an all-nighter in Lamont Library

* Go to an IOP event

* Comp an organization you'll learn to hate

* Jump off the Weeks bridge into the Charles River

* Go to a formal dance

* Write a Crimson op-ed

* Sex in the Widener stacks

* Get Wasted on Housing night

## Also, venture into Boston...

* Walk around Boston and visit the Commons, Newbury Street, and the Waterfront

* Run along the Charles

* Picnic on the Esplanade

* Kiss someone at night in front of the fountain in the Christian Science Center plaza

* Get drunk with Scorpion bowls and then cure a hangover at the Hong Kong

## And escape D-Hall food!

* Toro - a tapas place operated by Ken Oringer and my favorite place in Boston

* The Daily Catch - a hole-in-the-wall in the North End that serves fantastically fresh seafood. 

* Punjabi Dhaba - another hole-in-the-wall in Inman square serves the best Indian fare

* The Helmand - Delicious Afghani food. Don't miss the pumpkin appetizer!

* Addis Red Sea - A very lovely Ethiopian restaurant. 

* The Blue Room - Mediterranean food in Kendall Square. Very delectable. 

* Hungry Mother - French-style Southern food. A classy but quirky first or second date. 

* The Beehive - A loud and fun hangout. 

* Neptune Oyster - Best Oysters ever. 

* Ten Tables - A very romantic venue with delicious food. 

* Henrietta's Table - My favorite breakfast place.
