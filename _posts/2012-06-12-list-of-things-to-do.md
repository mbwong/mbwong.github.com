# My Bucket List at Harvard

After four years in Cambridge, I thought I'd make a list of things that I think a Harvard undergraduate should experienced. Some of these things I've personally enjoyed. Others I've heard are amazing. Anyway, this isn't the official bucket list, which consists merely of sex in Widener, Primal Scream, and pissing on the John Harvard statue. This list is longer, and hopefully will help you find more adventures during your time at Harvard. Good luck!

## First, the Harvard things

* Skip lecture
* See the Adam House's underground murals
* Copy someone else's problem set or go to office hours and beg for answers
* Visit the Sackler on an open house
* Procrastinate in the D-Hall
* Socialize / pull an all-nighter in Lamont Library
* Go to an IOP event
* Comp an organization you'll learn to hate
* Jump off the Weeks bridge into the Charles River
* Go to a formal dance
* Write a Crimson op-ed
* Housing night
* Streak during Primal Scream!

## Also, venture into Boston...

* Walk around Boston and visit the Commons, Newbury Street, and the Waterfront
* Run along the Charles
* Picnic on the Esplanade
* Kiss someone at night in front of the fountain in the Christian Science Center plaza
* Sail or kayak on the Charles
* See a Red Sox game at Fenway Park
* Spend a summer in Boston
* Visit the Isabella Gartner Museum
* See the Slut Cracker
* Catch a movie premier at a film festival
* Visit the MIT Media Lab
* Visit the Harpoon Brewery
* See a concert at the Middle East
* See a movie in the Sommerville Theatre and visit the Museum of Bad Art
* See an independent film at the Kendall Square theatre
* Get drunk with Scorpion bowls and then cure a hangover at the Hong Kong

## And escape D-Hall food!

* Punjabi Dhaba - another hole-in-the-wall in Inman square serves the best Indian fare ($)

* Toro - a tapas place operated by Ken Oringer and the most delicious meal I had in Boston ($$$)
