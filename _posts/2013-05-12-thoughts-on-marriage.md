# Thoughts on Marriage

Getting married is one of the most significant economic decisions one can make. Without having read much on family economics, let me speculate about when is marriage appropriate. In my mind there are several mechanisms at play: 

1. Marriage is a contract originally designed for childbearing. The basic reasoning is that two individuals pre-commit to a long-term project that takes twenty years to complete. Child-rearing is resource-intensive and the childbearing party needs a societally enforceable commitment. 

2. There are other reasons to get married: People might get married to maximize long-term joint production output by combining complementary non-tradable assets. For example, a big picture thinker pairs well with an detail-oriented person. A quiet thinker might benefit by pairing with a good communicator. Getting married brings together distinct skill sets necessary for household production and makes both people better able to achieve goals. Call this the "power couple" arrangement. 

3. People also get married to maximize immediate happiness. When one falls in love, one cannot imagine living without the other person. Getting married is an agreement to keep this person around to make oneself happier in the moment. 

4. Personal traits contribute to the utility gain from a marriage. These include alignment of goals, open-mindedness, flexibility, willingness and ability to communicate. These attributes are important to the success of a marriage. A stable marriage require both the capacity and the determination to continually improve along these dimensions. 

While (1) and (2) are strong economic reasons to get married, I find (3) much weaker. The danger is that the loving feeling is likely to dissipate over time. There is a risk of becoming stuck in an undesirable contract. After all, divorce is very costly, especially with kids around. 

It is best to get married when the long-term utility gain is very high. It rarely makes sense to get married if you don't want to have kids or you don't significantly help each other achieve goals. 

Of course, there is a lot of uncertainty involved in such long term planning. Dating is desirable for it improves information and reduces uncertainty. But there will always be "unknown unknowns." Luck will play a large role. So, best of luck too.
