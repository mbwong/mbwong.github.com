# Thoughts on Marriage

Getting married is one of the most significant economic decisions one can make. Without having read much on family economics, let me speculate about when marriage is appropriate. In my mind there are several mechanisms at play: 

1. People get married to have kids. The basic reasoning is that two individuals pre-commit to a long-term project that takes twenty years to complete. Child-rearing is resource-intensive and the childbearing party needs a societally enforceable commitment. 

2. People get married to bring together distinct skill sets. For example, a big picture thinker pairs well with an detail-oriented person. A quiet thinker might benefit by pairing with a good communicator. In this case, getting married  maximizes long-term joint production output by combining complementary non-tradable assets. Marriage makes both people better able to achieve goals. Think Hillary and Bill. Call this the "power couple" arrangement. 

3. People also get married to maximize immediate happiness. When one falls in love, one cannot imagine living without the other person. Loneliness sucks; getting married gives one a thrill and fulfillment otherwise difficult to obtain. 

4. Personal traits contribute to the strength of a marriage. These include alignment of goals, open-mindedness, flexibility, willingness and ability to communicate. These attributes are important to the success of a marriage. A stable marriage require both the capacity and the determination to continually improve along these dimensions. 

While (1) and (2) are strong economic reasons to get married, I find (3) much weaker. The loving feeling is likely to dissipate over time. If the incentive to stay married weakens, there is a significant risk of becoming stuck in an undesirable contract. Divorce is very costly, especially with kids around. 

It is best to get married when the long-term utility gain is very high. It is more difficult in the longer run to stay married if you don't want to have kids or you don't significantly help each other achieve goals. 

Of course, there is a lot of uncertainty involved in such long term planning. Dating is desirable for it improves information and reduces uncertainty. But there will always be "unknown unknowns." Luck will play a large role. So, best of luck too.
