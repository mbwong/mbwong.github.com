# Thoughts on Marriage

Getting married is one of the most significant economic decisions one can make. Without having read much on family economics, let me speculate about when marriage is appropriate. In my mind there are several mechanisms at play: 

1. People get married to have kids. A long commitment is necessary because child-rearing is resource-intensive. Since division of labor is efficient, two individuals commit to a long-term project that takes twenty years to complete. 

2. People get married to bring together distinct skill sets for other kinds of long-term production, i.e. career. For example, a big picture thinker pairs well with an detail-oriented person. A quiet thinker might benefit by pairing with a good communicator. In this case, getting married maximizes long-term joint production output by combining complementary non-tradable assets. Marriage makes both people better able to achieve goals. Think Hillary and Bill. Call this the "power couple" arrangement. 

3. People get married to lock in future consumption value. When you are in love, you get an enormous utility gain from your lover's company. Marriage is a commitment to continue to provide and receive this utility. 

4. People get married to maximize immediate happiness. Getting married gives one a thrill and fulfillment otherwise difficult to obtain. This is the "Vegas" marriage. 

Incentives matter. (1) and (2) are strong, rational economic reasons to get married. To align incentives, it is best to get married when the long-term utility gain is very high. It is probably difficult to stay together if you neither want to have kids nor significantly help each other achieve goals. 

(3) is an interesting case. In the West, romantic feelings are usually foundational for a marriage. This is not always universally true, however: arranged marriages are common in some societies to this day. 

I think arranged marriages are not without logic. Romantic feeling may dissipate over time, reducing the utility gain from marriage. Divorce is very costly, especially with kids around. If romantic feelings falter, one may become stuck in an undesirable contract. Making marriage a familial decision rather than individual choice can temper against short-sightedness. 

But incentives are not everything. Personal traits contribute to the strength of a marriage. Traits include alignment of goals, open-mindedness, flexibility, willingness and ability to communicate. A stable marriage require both the capacity and the determination to continually improve along these dimensions. 

Marriage is also subject to all kinds of shocks. Long-term personal relationships are probably overexposed to bad events, simply because bad events are more memorable. Trust is hard to build, easy to destroy. Over time relationships are likely fall into a certain pattern and it takes a lot of effort to change thereafter. It is probably important to start a relationship on the right footing and keep it that way.

There is also a lot of uncertainty involved in such long term planning. Dating is desirable for it improves information and reduces uncertainty. But there will always be "unknown unknowns." Luck will play a large role. 

Why do happy marriages seem so rare? Is the high incidence of divorce an institutional failure? Does it, perhaps, reveal something about human evolutionary psychology?
