# Finding Mentors and Professional Networking

A friend asks me a question:

> I lack a professional network, and don't really know anyone who is a leader in the general sector I'm interested in. I wish I could find a mentor or have more ways to find about what kind of steps would be helpful in the larger picture of my career. How do I go about building this kind of network or finding people with good advice to give? I realize I don't even know where to get started, how to initiate such a conversation and with whom. Do you have any suggestions? What's worked for you? 

Great question. There is a perception that networking is about collecting business cards and phone numbers. It is transaction-like. It is forced. It is scary. There is a sliver of truth in this view because it describes a particular kind of networking that happens, for example, when you need to collect a ton of contacts to sell a product to as many businesses as possible. Fortunately I've found that you generally don't have to do this. 

Instead, I approach professional networking as just making friends with people who are doing cool things and can help me do things I think are cool. I don't mean that one should network purely for personal gain. Rather, it is nice to have friends that have similar career interests as you. You can support each other even when everyone else in your life might be doubting what you're doing. 

Some of these friends might have a lot more experience than you, and the relationship between you might be more like mentor and advisee. Ideal mentors have knowledge that improve your thinking or some power to help you achieve your dreams. Most likely they are people in your field whom you want to emulate. They might be 20 years older or 5 years younger. Younger mentors will stick around for longer, so the payoff may be better. But keep an open mind because a mentor can be anybody. 

Before you look around for mentors, it's a good idea to reflect about what work you enjoy and better define your career goals. I find that people usually just tell you what had worked for them. The problem is: my goals may be different from theirs and what worked for them did not work for me. I ended up doing things that ended up not being so useful for my career. Clarity of goals will help you help you ask better questions and find people who can help you better. This does not mean you should have an unchanging image of yourself or that you should decide on the rest of your life now, but rather it is helpful to be more aware of your situation and your desires. 

Here are a couple approaches when I try to meet other people that have similar interests:

__Have a story.__ To help people understand what I'm interested in, I think about how to communicate my story. This way people understand where I come from or where I want to go and give me more relevant and helpful information. This [blog post from HBR][1] about how to put together a personal story explains it better than I can.

__Have something to offer.__ It is hard to develop a deeper relationship with someone if there is no economic incentive for you to interact. If I find someone who's doing work I believe in, I try to find some way to help that person. This doesn't mean I spend weeks digging through their work to try to change their lives. I just try to give them a reason to feel good about talking to me. Like, teach them something or let them know that I believe in their work. 

__Know the field.__ Knowing more things about your field and the people in it is very valuable. I try to follow relevant blogs and publications. I try to go to relevant events. When I do this, I am better at finding people whom I might want to talk to, bringing something to the table, and asking good questions. 

__Show up and introduce yourself.__ This is a critical step and all the rest means nothing if it's skipped. When I find someone who can help me, I try my best to work up the courage to introduce myself. I go to that book talk or seminar where they'll be and ask them if they knew about any interesting opportunities or ways to get started. If I have time, I tell them I'm interested in their work and see if they could use a person like me. If the person is not near, I cold-email and ask for a 5-minute phone call. It surprises me how well it works. When I was in college, I found out about a project at the MIT Media Lab that I thought was super cool, so I just emailed the person in charge telling him I was super excited about his work. Fast forward a week, I was in the Media Lab writing algorithms that could make the project better. People are generally willing to listen to you and help when you seem like a genuine and nice person. A lot of times getting advice is as simple as asking a question. 

__Persist.__ When I was working on my start-up idea, I was surprised by the degree to which passionate persistence can convince people to spend months helping you with a project you dreamed up. It is often said how Steve Jobs would harass his business partners with speeches for hours until they bent to his will. Emotional appeal and persistence can help you too. If you don't get a response from a cold email, write again to show you're really interested in learning about their work. Of course, there is a line when persistence can turn into annoyance, but this can usually be avoided by setting the right tone in your communications.  

__Be a friend.__ Ideally the strength of your bond with a mentor or colleague goes beyond a purely professional setting. In my experience the quickest way to make a friend is to be genuinely interested in their lives and problems. Help them if you can, open up about your own problems, ask them for advice, and listen. Find out about the people in their lives. Find out what they care about. If you can, meet their families. Bring them into your lives too. Have them meet your friends and family, however briefly and awkwardly. They will start thinking of you as someone whose well-being they care about. 

__Follow up and stay in touch.__ Under-promise and over-deliver. Reply to an email as soon as you get it. When you are responsive and responsible, people take you more seriously. For someone you've gotten to know, stay in touch to show that you care and you want them to stay updated. Tell them about your latest troubles and thoughts. With a mentor, frequent short email exchanges are great. As you develop this friendship, let them know what you've been up to. 

These step are really about finding people with similar career interests and then making friends with them. Usually it just means helping people and letting people help you. I hope that when you think about networking this way, it becomes less overwhelming and more enjoyable.
