#Travel Checklist

Where better to leave myself an easily accessible memo than the Internet? Apologies to you for this extremely boring post, but after two nearly disastrous trips to the airport, I desperately need to outsource my pre-travel mental checklist from my brain to a place that ensures that I don't forget things again. 

* drivers license, passport (visa if needed)
* computer, charger (adapter if needed)
* phone, charger (foreign SIM if needed)
* money, debit/credit cards, octopus cards
* appropriate clothing (coat, belt, ties, dress shoes, swim trunks as needed)
* appropriate gifts
* toiletries (razor, retainer)
* medication (allergy, painkiller)
* details of transportation and lodging arranged 

Did I leave anything? (Hope not.)
