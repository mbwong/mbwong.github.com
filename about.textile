<h2 id="intro">About the author and this site.</h2>

<div class="post">

My full name is Michael Bo-lin Wong. I live in San Francisco and work for Applied Predictive Technologies as a business consultant. I recently graduated from Harvard University, earning a bachelors in physics with highest honors. I grew up in Hong Kong.

I like a lot of things, but especially analyzing large datasets, building software, thinking about product design and distribution, economics, and human computation. For example, my favorite class at Harvard was "CS186 - Economics and Computation":http://http://www.seas.harvard.edu/courses/cs186/. 

During college summers, I crunched data for "Freakonomics author Steve Levitt":http://greatestgood.com and also at "McKinsey & Co":http://mckinsey.com. While school was in session, I worked as a research assistant at the Harvard Physics Department and a teaching fellow for Harvard's "CS51":http://cs51.seas.harvard.edu.

My proudest achievements so far include designing an online social events calendar for Harvard, leading an effort to reform residential life at my boarding high school, travelling alone through India, and performing with an orchestra as a solo bassoonist. 

I like food from all corners of the world. I enjoy pinot noir, puer tea, and decaffienated coffee. Friends generally classify my musical taste as "indie", but I enjoy classical, jazz, and occasionally rap as well. 

My politics are best described as pragmatic. Broadly speaking, I am a social liberal and a fiscal moderate. If I am unsure about a topic, I generally defer to The Economist newspaper. 

The design of this site is based on "Alex Payne's website":http://al3x.net. I currently host this website using github and use the "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/tree/master static site generation system.
